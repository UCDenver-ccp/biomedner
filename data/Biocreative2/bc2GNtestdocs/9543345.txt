Human mitochondrial function during cardiac growth and development.

Little information is presently available concerning mitochondrial respiratory and oxidative phosphorylation function in the normal human heart during growth and development. We investigated the levels of specific mitochondrial enzyme activities and content during cardiac growth and development from the early neonatal period (10-20 days) to adulthood (67 years). Biochemical analysis of enzyme specific activities and content and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was performed with left ventricular tissues derived from 30 control individuals. The levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and complex V specific activity, mtDNA copy number and COX subunit II content remained unchanged in contrast to increased citrate synthase (CS) activity and content. The developmental increase in CS activity paralleled increasing CS polypeptide content, but was neither related to overall increases in mitochondrial number nor coordinately regulated with mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities. Our findings of unchanged levels of cardiac mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity during the progression from early childhood to older adult contrasts with the age-specific regulation found with CS, a Krebs cycle mitochondrial enzyme.
