A novel immunoglobulin superfamily receptor (19A) related to CD2 is expressed on activated lymphocytes and promotes homotypic B-cell adhesion.

A novel lymphocyte-specific immunoglobulin superfamily protein (19A) has been cloned. The predicted 335-amino-acid sequence of 19A represents a Type 1 membrane protein with homology with the CD2 family of receptors. A molecular model of the two predicted extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains of 19A has been generated using the crystal structure of CD2 as a template. In isolated lymphocytes, expression of 19A is induced by various activation stimuli, and enforced expression of the 19A gene promotes homotypic cell adhesion in a B-cell-line model. Collectively these data imply that the 19A protein plays a role in regulation of lymphocyte adhesion.
