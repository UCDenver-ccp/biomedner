Uroplakin II gene is expressed in transitional cell carcinoma but not in bilharzial bladder squamous cell carcinoma: alternative pathways of bladder epithelial differentiation and tumor formation.

Uroplakins (UPs) are integral membrane proteins that are synthesized as the major differentiation products of mammalian urothelium. We have cloned the human UP-II gene and localized it on chromosome 11q23. A survey of 50 transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) revealed a UP-II polymorphism but no tumor-specific mutations. Immunohistochemical staining using rabbit antisera against a synthetic peptide of UP-II and against total UPs showed UP reactivity in 39.5% (17 of 43 cases) of conventional TCCs, 12.8% (5 of 39) of bilharzial-related TCCs, and 2.7% (1 of 36) of bilharzial-related squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The finding that fewer bilharzial TCCs express UPs than conventional TCCs (12.8 versus 40%) raised the possibility that the former are heterogeneous, expressing SCC features to varying degrees. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that urothelium can undergo at least three pathways of differentiation: (a) urothelium-type pathway; (b) epidermis-type pathway; and (c) glandular-type pathway, characterized by the production of UPs, K1/K10 keratins, and secreted glycoproteins, respectively. Vitamin A deficiency and mesenchymal factors may play a role in determining the relative contributions of these pathways to urothelial differentiation as well as to the formation of TCC, SCC, and adenocarcinoma, or a mixture thereof.
