TACC1-chTOG-Aurora A protein complex in breast cancer.

The three human TACC (transforming acidic coiled-coil) genes encode a family of proteins with poorly defined functions that are suspected to play a role in oncogenesis. A Xenopus TACC homolog called Maskin is involved in translational control, while Drosophila D-TACC interacts with the microtubule-associated protein MSPS (Mini SPindleS) to ensure proper dynamics of spindle pole microtubules during cell division. We have delineated here the interactions of TACC1 with four proteins, namely the microtubule-associated chTOG (colonic and hepatic tumor-overexpressed gene) protein (ortholog of Drosophila MSPS), the adaptor protein TRAP (tudor repeat associator with PCTAIRE2), the mitotic serine/threonine kinase Aurora A and the mRNA regulator LSM7 (Like-Sm protein 7). To measure the relevance of the TACC1-associated complex in human cancer we have examined the expression of the three TACC, chTOG and Aurora A in breast cancer using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. We show that expressions of TACC1, TACC2, TACC3 and Aurora A are significantly correlated and downregulated in a subset of breast tumors. Using siRNAs, we further show that depletion of chTOG and, to a lesser extent of TACC1, perturbates cell division. We propose that TACC proteins, which we also named 'Taxins', control mRNA translation and cell division in conjunction with microtubule organization and in association with chTOG and Aurora A, and that these complexes and cell processes may be affected during mammary gland oncogenesis.
