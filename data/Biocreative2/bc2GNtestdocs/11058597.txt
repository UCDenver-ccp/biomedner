IL-17E, a novel proinflammatory ligand for the IL-17 receptor homolog IL-17Rh1.

We report identification of interleukin (IL)-17E, a novel member of the IL-17 family of cytokines. IL-17E is a ligand for the recently identified protein termed EVI27/IL-17BR, which we term IL-17 receptor homolog 1 (IL-17Rh1) in light of the multiple reported ligand-receptor relationships. Murine EVI27 was identified through its location at a common site of retroviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid leukemias. IL-17Rh1 shows highest level expression in kidney with moderate expression in multiple other organs, whereas IL-17E mRNA was detected at very low levels in several peripheral tissues. IL-17E induces activation of NF-kappaB and stimulates production of the proinflammatory chemokine IL-8.
