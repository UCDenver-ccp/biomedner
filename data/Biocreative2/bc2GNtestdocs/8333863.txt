cDNA cloning and expression of two new members of the human liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B subfamily.

Two new UDP-glucuronosyltransferase cDNAs, designated UGT2B10 and UGT2B11, encoding 528 amino acid proteins were isolated from a human liver cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequences of UGTs 2B10 and 2B11 share > 76% sequence similarity with other known human liver UGT2B subfamily isoforms and < 48% sequence similarity with UGT1 family proteins. COS-7 cells transfected with UGT 2B10 and 2B11 synthesized proteins with respective molecular masses of 49kDa and 51kDa. UGT2B11 expressed in COS-7 cells glucuronidated a number of polyhydroxylated estrogens (estriol, 4-hydroxyestrone and 2-hydroxyestriol) and xenobiotics (4-methylumbelliferone, 1-naphthol, 4-nitrophenol, 2-aminophenol, 4-hydroxybiphenyl and menthol). Despite the screening of more than forty potential substrates, glucuronidation activity was not observed for expressed UGT2B10.
