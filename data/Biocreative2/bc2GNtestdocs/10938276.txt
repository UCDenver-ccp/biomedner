A human gene coding for a membrane-associated nucleic acid-binding protein.

Studies to clone a cell-surface DNA-binding protein involved in the binding and internalization of extracellular DNA have led to the isolation of a gene for a membrane-associated nucleic acid-binding protein (MNAB). The full-length cDNA is 4.3 kilobases with an open reading frame of 3576 base pairs encoding a protein of approximately 130 kDa (GenBank accession numbers and ). The MNAB gene is on human chromosome 9 with wide expression in normal tissues and tumor cells. A C3HC4 RING finger and a CCCH zinc finger have been identified in the amino-terminal half of the protein. MNAB bound DNA (K(D) approximately 4 nm) and mutagenesis of a single conserved amino acid in the zinc finger reduced DNA binding by 50%. A potential transmembrane domain exists near the carboxyl terminus. Antibodies against the amino-terminal half of the protein immunoprecipitated a protein of molecular mass approximately 150 kDa and reacted with cell surfaces. The MNAB protein is membrane-associated and primarily localized to the perinuclear space, probably to the endoplasmic reticulum or trans-Golgi network. Characterization of the MNAB protein as a cell-surface DNA-binding protein, critical in binding and internalization of extracellular DNA, awaits confirmation of its localization to cell surfaces.
