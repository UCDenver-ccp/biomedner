Characterization of C14orf4, a novel intronless human gene containing a polyglutamine repeat, mapped to the ARVD1 critical region.

Within the ARVD1 (arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy, type 1) critical region, mapped to 14q24.3, we detected an intronless gene of 4859 bp, predominantly expressed in the heart tissue. This gene encodes a 796-amino-acid, proline-rich protein showing polyglutamine and polyalanine tracks with variable length at the N-terminus and a C3HC4 RING finger domain at the C-terminus. CREB and AP-2 binding sites are present in the promoter region. The 5' flanking region contains neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box, but it is high in GC content and includes several Sp1 binding sites. Protein similarity searches revealed a significant match between the C-terminus and a human hypothetical protein, whose gene is located on the chromosome 19 long arm. The predicted protein shows PEST sequences, suggesting its rapid degradation. The novel intronless gene, provisionally named C14orf4 and probably encoding a nuclear protein, was excluded from being the ARVD1 gene.
