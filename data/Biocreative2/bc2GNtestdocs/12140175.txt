Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation attenuates beta-lapachone-induced necrotic cell death in human osteosarcoma cells.

beta-Lapachone, a novel anticancer drug, induces various human carcinoma cells to undergo apoptotic cell death. However, we report here that, in human osteocarcinoma (U2-OS) cells, beta-lapachone induces necrosis rather than apoptosis. beta-Lapachone-induced necrotic cell death in U2-OS cells was characterized by propidium iodide uptake, cytochrome c release, a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP depletion. The mitochondrial potential transition (MPT), including the reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, occurred in beta-lapachone-treated cells; cotreatment of these cells with cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of MPT pore, failed to prevent necrotic cell death. This indicates that the MPT transition does not play a crucial role in this process. Furthermore, beta-lapachone-induced necrosis was independent of oxidative stress and caspase activation. However, excessive poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation and subsequent depletion of intracellular NAD(+) and ATP were seen in beta-lapachone-treated U2-OS cells. Cotreatment with a PARP inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide, decreased beta-lapachone-induced PARP activation and provided significant protection from necrosis by preventing depletion of intracellular NAD(+) and ATP. Taken together, our results suggest that PARP plays an important role in the signaling pathway for beta-lapachone-induced necrosis in U2-OS cells.
