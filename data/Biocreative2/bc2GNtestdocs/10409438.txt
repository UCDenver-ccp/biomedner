Cloning and mapping of the XRN2 gene to human chromosome 20p11.1-p11.2.

The Dhm1 gene is the mouse homologue of the dhp1(+) gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is involved in homologous recombination and RNA metabolism, such as RNA synthesis and RNA trafficking, in S. pombe. Complementation analysis showed the Dhm1 gene on a multicopy plasmid can rescue the temperature-sensitivity mutation of dhp1(ts) and the lethality of the dhp1 null mutation. This finding suggests that Dhm1 has a function in mouse similar to that of dhp1(+). The human homologue of this gene, XRN2, has been identified. A 3.6-kb transcript of XRN2 was detected in 16 tissues examined and was more abundant in testis. By radiation hybrid panel mapping, the XRN2 gene was localized to chromosome 20p11.1-p11.2 between markers D20S180 and D20S871.
