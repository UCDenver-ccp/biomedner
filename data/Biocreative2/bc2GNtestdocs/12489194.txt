The human tuftelin gene and the expression of tuftelin in mineralizing and nonmineralizing tissues.

Tuftelin has been suggested to play an important role during the development and mineralization of enamel, but its precise function is still unclear. This article reviews major milestones in the discovery, structural characterization, expression, localization, and conservation of tuftelin in different vertebrate species. It focuses on the structure of the human tuftelin gene, which has recently been deciphered [12]. It describes the exon-intron organization, sizes and structure, the promoter structure, and the newly discovered alternatively spliced human tooth-bud tuftelin mRNA transcripts. It also examines information on the structural motifs in the human-derived tuftelin protein and how they relate to tuftelin from other species. It reviews our recent results on the transcription of tuftelin mRNA and protein expression in several nonmineralizing soft tissues, using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by DNA cloning and sequencing, indirect immunohistochemistry, immunohistochemistry combined with confocal microscopy, and in situ hybridization. These results and earlier Northern blot results show that tuftelin, in addition to being expressed in the developing and mineralizing tooth, is also expressed in several nonmineralizing soft tissues, suggesting that tuftelin has a universal function and/or a multifunctional role.
