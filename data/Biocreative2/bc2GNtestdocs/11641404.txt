The p53 family member genes are involved in the Notch signal pathway.

The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor that regulates cell growth and death in response to environmental stimuli such as DNA damage. p63/p51 and p73 were recently identified as members of the p53 gene family. In contrast to p53 however, p63 and p73 are rarely mutated in human cancers. Mice that lack p53 are developmentally normal, while p63 and p73 appear to play critical roles in normal development. To determine how p63 and p73 are involved in normal development, we attempted to identify target genes that are specifically regulated by p63 and/or p73 but not by p53. We found that the Jagged1 (JAG1) and Jagged2 (JAG2) genes, encoding ligands for the Notch receptors, are up-regulated by p63 and p73. Furthermore, we identified a p63-binding site in the second intron of the JAG1 gene, which can directly interact with the p63 protein in vivo, as assessed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. A heterologous reporter assay revealed that this p63-binding site is a functional response element and is specific for p63. We also found a target of Notch signaling, HES-1 was up-regulated in Jurkat cells, in which Notch1 is highly expressed, when co-cultured with p63-transfected cells, suggesting that p63 can trigger the Notch signal pathway in neighboring cells. Our findings show an association between the p53 family genes and Notch signaling and suggest a potential molecular mechanism for the involvement of the p53 family genes in normal development.
