Cloning of CCRL1, an orphan seven transmembrane receptor related to chemokine receptors, expressed abundantly in the heart.

In an attempt to identify novel chemokine receptor genes, cDNA expressed sequence tags (EST) were analyzed for a significant homology with mammalian chemokine receptors. The sequence from one of the selected EST clones was used to generate a full-length cDNA encoding a putative seven transmembrane receptor, CCRL1-CC chemokine receptor like 1. The full-length receptor encodes a polypeptide of 350 amino acids and has about 35% homology to the chemokine receptors CCR6 and CCR7. Northern blot analysis indicates predominant expression of about 5.0, 2.0 and 1.3kb mRNA forms in human heart tissue, while low-level expression of the 2.0 and 1.3kb forms was observed in lung, pancreas and spleen and in fetal tissues. In-situ hybridization confirmed the presence of CCRL1 mRNA in cardiac muscle cells. Similar to the chemokine receptor CCR6, CCRL1 maps to chromosome 6 and has one intron in the 5' untranslated region. Coupled transcription-translation of CCRL1 cDNA yielded a glycosylated polypeptide of about 45kDa.
