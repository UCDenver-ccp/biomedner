Isolation, tissue distribution, and chromosomal localization of the human activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene.

The gene encoding activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a member of the cytidine deaminase family, was isolated from a murine B cell lymphoma line, CH12F3-2, induced by combined stimulation of TGF-beta, IL-4, and CD40L. We have isolated the human orthologue of mouse AID cDNA, which has an open reading frame of 198 residues containing a conserved cytidine deaminase motif. The amino acid sequence of human AID is 92% identical to that of mouse AID. RT-PCR analysis of 15 human tissues showed that AID mRNA is expressed strongly in lymph nodes and tonsils. The complete human AID gene consisting of five exons was isolated and mapped to chromosome 12p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
