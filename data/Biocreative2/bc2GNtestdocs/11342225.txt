Identification of the human crooked neck gene by comparative gene identification.

Drosophila melanogaster serves as a useful model organism for functional genomic studies, and its genome project was recently completed. We previously described a comparative-gene-identification approach to assist human ortholog gene identification that involves applying an entire proteome as an alignment template. Analysis of the available 14100 Drosophila protein sequences revealed that 37% of them (5228 sequences) might lead to discoveries of novel human genes. Upon further database interrogations, we found several putative full-length human gene transcripts, including the human crooked neck (crn) gene. Based on sequence gap-closure experiments using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as well as bioinformatic analysis, we found that the assembled human cDNA contig of crooked neck gene was at least 3903 base pairs in length with alternative splicing variations which encoded mainly for a 687-amino-acid residue protein. The human crooked neck gene was located on chromosome 20 with at least 15 exons. The unique features of the 16 copies of the tetratrico peptide repeat (TPR) motif were conserved in the yeast, fly and human crooked neck orthologous proteins, which were important for spliceosome assembly in cells.
