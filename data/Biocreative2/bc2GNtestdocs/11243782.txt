Identification of muscle specific ring finger proteins as potential regulators of the titin kinase domain.

The giant myofibrillar protein titin contains within its C-terminal region a serine-threonine kinase of unknown function. We have identified a novel muscle specific RING finger protein, referred to as MURF-1, that binds in vitro to the titin repeats A168/A169 adjacent to the titin kinase domain. In myofibrils, MURF-1 is present within the periphery of the M-line lattice in close proximity to titin's catalytic kinase domain, within the Z-line lattice, and also in soluble form within the cytoplasm. Yeast two-hybrid screens with MURF-1 as a bait identified two other highly homologous MURF proteins, MURF-2 and MURF-3. MURF-1,2,3 proteins are encoded by distinct genes, share highly conserved N-terminal RING domains and in vitro form dimers/heterodimers by shared coiled-coil motifs. Of the MURF family, only MURF-1 interacts with titin repeats A168/A169, whereas MURF-3 has been reported to affect microtubule stability. Association of MURF-1 with M-line titin may potentially modulate titin's kinase activity similar to other known kinase-associated proteins, whereas differential expression and heterodimerization of MURF1, 2 and 3 may link together titin kinase and microtubule-dependent signal pathways in striated muscles.
