Expression of CaT-like, a novel calcium-selective channel, correlates with the malignancy of prostate cancer.

The regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) plays a key role in the development and growth of cells. Here we report the cloning and functional expression of a highly calcium-selective channel localized on the human chromosome 7. The sequence of the new channel is structurally related to the gene product of the CaT1 protein cloned from rat duodenum and is therefore called CaT-like (CaT-L). CaT-L is expressed in locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic and androgen-insensitive prostatic lesions but is undetectable in healthy prostate tissue and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Additionally, CaT-L is expressed in normal placenta, exocrine pancreas, and salivary glands. New markers with well defined biological function that correlate with aberrant cell growth are needed for the molecular staging of cancer and to predict the clinical outcome. The human CaT-L channel represents a marker for prostate cancer progression and may serve as a target for therapeutic strategies.
