Banner, Alian D' Arcy, Wolfgang Janes, Reiner Gentz, Hans-Joachim Schoenfeid, Clemens Broger, Hansruedi Loetscher, and Werner Lessiauer F. Hoffmann-La Roche Limited Pharmaceutical Research-New Technologies CH-4002 Base1 Switzerland types TNF-R55 and TNF-R75 (reviewed by Loetscher et al., 1991 a). TNF-R55 and TNF-R75 have clear sequence similarity in their extracellular regions, where both contain a characteristic 8-cysteine consensus motif repeated four times. In contrast, their cytoplasmic region sequences are entirely unrelated, suggesting different modes of signaling and function (Dembic et al., 1990; Loetscher et al., 1990; Schall et al., 1990; Smith et al., 1990). Distinct activities, presumably due to the interaction with different components of the downstream signal transduction chain, have indeed been found in several studies (Gehr et al., 1992; Heiler et al., 1992; Tartaglia et al., 1991). in addition to the receptors and ligands, two soluble TNF inhibitory proteins have been discovered and shown to be truncated extracelMar regions of the two receptors (Engelmann et al., 1990; Olsson et al., 1989; Seckinger et al., 1990). The active form of both TNFa and TNF8 appears to be the trimeric molecule. Both factors crystallize in the trimeric form (Eck and Sprang, 1989; Eck et al., 1992; Hakoshimaand Tomita, 1988; Jones et al., 1989). Trimeric TNFa and TNF8 have also been detected in solution, and recombinant TNFa and TNF8 were found to combine in solution with soluble TNF receptors to form complexes in which three receptor molecules bind to one TNFa or TNFj3 trimer (Loetscher et al., 1991 b; Schoenfeld et al., 1991). The trimeric TNF molecule, as conventionally depicted, is broader at the bottom and narrower at the top (Eck and Sprang, 1989; Eck et al., 1992; Hakoshima and Tomita, 1988; Jones et al., 1989). Numerous studies have attempted to map the receptor-binding regions of TNFa and TNFj3 by correlating the location of point mutations introduced in the ligand with the effects on receptor binding (for example, Goh et al., 1991; van Ostade et al., 1991; Yamagishi et al., 1990). A consensus emerged that mutations in TNF residues on two separate, relatively small areas on surface loops located toward the bottom of the subunit are functionally most relevant. In the trimer, these areas face each other across the surface groove between two subunits. This suggests that one receptor interacts with the sites on two adjacent subunits, and that the TNF trimer thus has three spatially distinct but equivalent receptor-binding sites. We have solved the crystal structure of the complex of the soluble extracellular region of the 55 kd TNF receptor, sTNFB55, with TNFj3 and report the novel structures of the receptor fragment and of its ligand complex. We propose that the structure of this complex reflects the activated state of the TNF receptor at the cell surface and provides a model for TNF signal generation. Results Crystal Structure Determinations Human TNFj3 with the full-length sequence of 171 amino acids (Figure 1A) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in the biologically active trimeric form as previously described (Schoenfeid et al., 1991). The soluble  Summary The X-ray crystal structure of the complex of the extracellular domain of the human 55 kd tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor with human TNFf3 has been determined at 2.85 A resolution. The complex has three receptor molecules bound symmetrically to one TNF8 trimer. The receptor fragment, a very elongated end to end assembly of four similar folding domains, binds in the groove between two adjacent TNFp subunits. The structure of the complex defines the orientation of the ligand with respect to the ceil membrane and provides a model for TNF receptor activation. The novel fold of the TNF receptor structure is likely to be representative of the nerve growth factor (NGF)/TNF receptor family as a whole. Introduction Our present understanding of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) system is the result of a century of research. In 1893, for example, Coley reported on his observations on curative effects of bacterial infections in terminally ill cancer patients (Coley, 1893). in later decades it was discovered that the antitumor activity seen in Coley' studies s is indirect: bacterial products such as endotoxin elicit the release of a host-derived factor(s), which in turn brings about the antitumor effect (Carswell et al., 1975; Shear et al., 1943). in experimental animal tumors, this factor(s) was found to induce a hemorrhagic necrosis of tumor tissue and thus was called tumor necrosis factor(s), TNF (Old, 1985). Independent studies of the metabolic sequelae of chronic disease led to the discovery of cachectin and the demonstration that it is identical to TNFa (Beutler et al., 1985). in a different context, lymphotoxin was identified in investigations on cytotoxic activities released by T lymphocytes (reviewed by Paul and Ruddle, 1988). With the advent of molecular biology, it was realized that TNFal cachectin and lymphotoxin (now often referred to as TNF8) are two closely related factors (see Nedwin et al., 1985); they are now recognized as potent cytokines with a wide range of activities, functioning in host defense to bacterial infection and as mediators in inflammatory or immunologic reactions (for a recent review see Beutler, 1992). TNFa and TNFf3 have highly similar overall structures, despite their relatively low sequence identity (33%) and they compete for binding to each of the two TNF receptor  A TNFB TNFA LPGVGLTPSAAQTARQHPKMHLAHSTLKPAAHLIGDPSKQNSLLWRANTD50 VRSSSRTPSD-----------------KPVAHWANPQAEGQLQWLNRRA 33 I I I I aaa" xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXXXXX I I I aaaaaaa I I  Figure 1.

Disordered regions in the structure of the uncomplexed TNFl3 are marked with x. Forty-nine residues (33%) of the ordered region of TNFa (1 I-157) are conserved in TNF3. (B) Aligned amino acid sequences of the two human TNF receptor extracellular regions. The human sTNFB55 sequence (P55) is shown aligned with the corresponding sequence from the human 75 kd TNF receptor (P75). The four sequence domains are aligned so that the conserved cysteines (in boldface) line upvertically. The intervening sequences are left-justified except where there are strong structural reasons to do otherwise. The disulfide connectivity as determined for the first three domains of sTNFR55 is shown above domain 1. Residues crucial for domain folding (see text) are marked by number signs and dollar signs, the three potential glycosylation sites by exclamation points, and the presumed extradisulfide bridge in P75 by an asterisk. Residues that in domains 3 and 4 of P75 replace otherwise conserved cysteines are underlined.  bbbb' I  bbbb I  cc~ccccccccc I  xxxxxxxxx I  dddddd  TNFB TNFA  RAFLQDGFSLSNNSLLVPTSGIYFVYSQWFSGKAYSPKATSSPLYLAHE 100 NALLANGVELRDNQLWPSEGLYLIYSQVLFKGQGCP----STHVLLTHT 79 I I I I dddd xxxxxeeeeeeeeeee fffffffffff g I I I I I VQLFSSQYPFHVPLLSSQKMVYP------GLQEPWLHSMYHGAAFQLTQG 144 ISRIAVSYQTKVNLLSAIKSPCQRETPEGAEAKPWYEPIYLGGVFQLEKG 129 I I I I I hhhhhhh I I I DQLSTHTDGIPHLVLSPST-VFFGAFAL 171 DRLSAEINRPDYLDFAESGQVYFGIIAL 157 I I I ggggwgg  I  TNFB TNFA  TNFB TNFA  B 11 1 P55 LVPHLGDREKRDS P75 LPAQVAFTPYAPEPGS 1 I 11  ------,~-"` -~,---,~` --------"~ I---15 I $ !

It comprises all four of the sequence domains that are characterized by the 6-cysteine repeat motif that identifies members of the nerve growth factor (NGF)/TNF receptor gene family. sTNFR55 approximates the sequence of the natural TNF inhibitory protein, TNF-BPI, but extends it by 11 amino acids at the N-terminus and by 10 residues at the C-terminus (Engelmann et al., 1990; Olsson et al., 1989; Seckinger et al., 1990). Both TNF8 and sTNFR55 were purified such that no contaminants were observed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Crystals of the TNFP-sTNFR55 complex were grown as described (D' Arcy et al., 1993). Some of these crystals were washed, redissolved, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein staining revealed TNF8 and sTNFR55 bands of intensities compatible with a ratio of approximately 3 sTNF-R55 mole cules  per TNF8 trimer. The crystals belong to the bodycentered cubic space group 123 (Tables l-5). Eight identical molecular structures of exact 3-fold symmetry are present in the unit cell, each therefore containing three sTNF-R55 chains and three monomeric TNF8 subunit8 (i.e., oneTNF8 trimer). Crystalsof full-length TNF8 belong to the different body-centered cubic space group, l2,3, and contain eight identical symmetrical trimers per unit cell (D' Arcy et al., 1993). The crystal structure of the TNFf3-sTNF-R55 complex was solved by the heavy atom multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) method combined with solvent flattening as described in Experimental Procedures. The ligand trimer was located, and a number of putative disulfide bridges were identified in the receptor region of the electron density (e.g., Figure 2A) and were connected to give a model for residues 15-150 of sTNF-R55. Refinement proceeded smoothly to an R factor of 18.8% at 2.85 A resolution, corresponding to a root-mean-square (RMS) error of 0.3 A in the coordinates according to the analysis of Read (1986). The Structure of the Ligand The structure of full-length TNFf3 was solved by molecular replacement, starting from the known structure of TNFa (Eck and Sprang, 1989; Jones et al., 1989). Eck et al. (1992) recently described the structure of a truncated TNF8 lacking the first 23 amino acids. In both the complexed and uncomplexed TNF8 crystal structures described here, residues l-26 are disordered. Lys-28 is the first well-ordered residue and is thus the effective N-terminus, as also found for the corresponding residue of TNFa. The ordered part of the structure of the full-length TNF8 is very similar to that of the truncated molecule reported by Eck et al. (1992). This demonstrate8 that the first 23 amino acids do not materially influence either the ligand structure or receptor binding.  Table 2.

The TNFa and TNF6 trimers both have the shape of a truncated pyramid and are conventionally depicted with the 3-fold symmetry axis vertical and the broader part of the molecule at the bottom (Figure 3). The TNFf3 monomer is an all-p protein, with two 6 sheets, f-c-h-a-a" and e-d-g-b-b' At the top of the trimer, the four long, consecu. tive 6 strands, c, d, 8, and f, come together and the intervening c-d and e-f loops protrude upward. In the lower part of the molecule, each sheet has five strands. The d-e loop is the most exposed, and between strands a and a" is an extended structure, a' that is not part of either 6 , sheet. The TNF5 trimer is about 60 8, high, with approximate diameters of 30 8, at the top and 50 A at the bottom, and is compact, but has a surface groove between the d-e loop of one subunit and the a-a" region of the next (Figure 3). The C-terminus and the effective N-terminus come close together near the 3-fold axis at the bottom of the molecule. The overall structure is extremely similar to that of TNFa. In the TNF6 crystal structure, the c-d loops are poorly ordered and the e-f loops surround a funnelshaped depression not present in TNFa. Taking the C, coordinates of 99 structurally equivalent residues (TNF6 26-47, 52-63, 94-105, 111-119, 131-148, 164-171; TNFa l l-30,35-66,73-84, 90-98, 116-l 33, 150-l 57), the RMS difference after optimal superposition of TNFa on TNF6 is 0.65 A, and this only increases to 0.85 A for the equivalent 297 residues of the trimers. The TNFa and  TNF6 monomers thus have identical 6 sheet structures and pack together internally in exactly the same way in the trimer. In contrast, the surfaces of the TNFa and TNFf3 trimers differ everywhere in detail. Only 17 surface residues per monomer are conserved between the two structures, and most of these are partly buried and are consewed for structural reasons. Some exposed regions of the TNFf3 molecule are disordered. Residues 65-93 of the c-d loop and residues 106-l 10 of the d-e loop have no observable structure, and residues 40-42, 51,62,83, 64, 104, 111, 126, and 127 have multiple conformations. Overall Structure of the Ligand-Receptor Complex The sTNFR55 molecules in the complex with TNFf3 are very long and narrow and bind with their long axes roughly parallel to the 3-fold axis of the TNF6 trimer (Figures 4a and 4b). At the bottom of the TNFf3 trimer, the N-terminal region of each sTNFR55 molecule binds in the shallow surface groove formed between the d-e loop of one subunit and the a-a" region of the next. Further up, the central region of the somewhat bent sTNFR55 molecule contacts only 1 of these 2 TNF5 subunits, but at the top the C-terminal part of the sTNF-R55 molecule interacts again with both. The orientation of the ligand with respect to the cell membrane has thus been defined, as the membranespanning sequence of the full receptor is C-terminal to the sTNF-R55 sequence. The TNFf3 trimer thus binds to the  TNF-TNF 435  Receptor  Crystal Structure  Figure 2.

Thedisulfide bridge 55-70 gave the strongest electron density feature in the receptor region, but the main chain density of both residues 55 and 70 was very weak around the -NH. In contrast, 66 and 73 have good main chain density but are very weak around the CB positions and the disulfide is weaker than, for example, the hydrogen-bonded bridge from Asp-93 to Ser-74. Phe60 is also weak, and Arg-92 has no side chain density and poor main chain connectivity. Carbony1 oxygens cannot be identified. The model shown is that obtained after the final refinement cycle and corresponds to the electron density in (6). (B) Final electron density, at 2.65 A resolution, shown at the 20 level, for comparison with the initial electron density shown in (A). A water molecule can be seen on the carbonyl of Ser72.

Arg92 is disordered.  receptor at the cell surface with its narrower end pointing toward the membrane. The sTNFR55 molecules are about 85 A long and protrude beyond the ends of the TNF8 trimer at both the top and bottom. In Figure 4c, where the TNF8-sTNFR55 complex is shown viewed down the 3-fold axis, it may clearly be seen that the three sTNF-Fl55 molecules in the complex are well separated from each other. The sTNFR55 model is only complete at the C-terminal end as far as residue 150, with the C, atom of this residue separated from the symmetry-equivalent C, atoms by 44 A. We cannot exclude the possibility, therefore, that some of the amino acids C-terminal to residue 150 could contact each other on or near the 3-fold axis, but the weak electron density for receptor residues 151-l 82 suggests that the three sTNF-R55 molecules bound to one TNFp trimer do not interact strongly. The Structure of the Receptor in the Complex The structure of sTNF-R55 as found in the complex is shown in Figures 4-8 and in Table 8. The molecule is very elongated and slightly bent, as is best appreciated in Figure 4b. In this figure, the four sequence domains defined by the cysteine repeat motif are given different colors, and it may be seen that they are real structural entities, arranged end to end in linear fashion with little overlap. The Scysteine residues of each domain are found to form three intradomain disulfide bridges, indicated in Figures 1 B and 4b. Remarkably, the disulfide bonds are arranged like the rungs of a slightly twisted ladder, evenly  Figure 3. The TNFf3 Trimer The 6 strands for one subunit are shown as arrows, labeled in the notation of Eck et al. (1992). In both the complexed and uncomplexed trimers, the residues in the strands of the two 6 sheets are: in the inner sheet, a", 53-55; a, 29-35; h, 164-170; c, 72-63; and 1, 129139; and in the outer sheet, b' 56-61; b, 64-67; g, 144-152; d, 95, 104; and e, 11 l-l 21.

The peptide fold that produces this novel arrangement is shown in Figures 4-6. Domain 2 has 41 residues and domain 3 has 46. These two domains have the same disulfide connectivity and a common 24-residue core structure (Table 6) whose C, atoms may be superposed with an RMS deviation of - 1 A. The superposition is shown in Figures 4d and 5 and shown schematically in Figure 6. Domain 2 (residues 54-97) will be described first. Cysteines 55 and 70, the first two of the domain, are disulfide bridged to form a long 1 b-residue loop (loop 1) whose central part runs at right angles to the long axis of the molecule. The three cysteines of the central Cys-x-x-Cys-x-xCys motif (Cys-70, Cys-73, and Cys-76) are in an extended conformation on the first up-strand. This is followed by a 6-residue loop (loop 2, Arg-77-Gln-62) of open structure. Residues Val-63-Ser-66 form a kink (8 meander) leading into the down-strand, residues lie-65-Val-90. The downstrand is connected via a 6 bend (loop 3, Thr-69-Arg-92) to the second up-strand, creating a strand-turn-strand structure where the strands lie 4.75-5.0 A apart. Both of  these latter strands are spaced 5.75-6.0 A from the first up-strand, which is disulfide bridged to the down-strand by the second disulfide bridge (Cys-73-Cys-88) and to the second up-strand by the third disulfide bridge (Cys-76Cys-96). The second and third disulfide bridges create long loops whose sequences overlap (see Figure 1B). Some residues critical for folding are indicated in Figures 1 Band 6. In domain 2, immediately before the last cysteine there is a conserved Asp-Thr-Val sequence (93-95) and directly after the central cysteine of the Cys-x-x-Cys-x-xCys motif there is aconserved serine (Ser-74). This residue bridges the first up-strand to the second up-strand by making a total of three hydrogen bonds. The -NH and 0, of Ser-74 hydrogen bond to the side chain of Asp-93, forming a first bridge, and the Ser-74 carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bonds to the 0, of Thr-94, forming a second bridge (Figure 6). The Thr-94 methyl group packs against the third disulfide bridge (Cys-76-Cys-96). The structure is further stabilized by the side chain of Phe-60, which interacts with both the second disulfide bridge and the Ser-74-Asp-93 hydrogen bond bridge. Domain 3 has the same core structure as domain 2 and,  Figure 4. The Complex  of TNF6 with sTNF-R55  (a) Side view of the complex of TNFj3 with sTNF-R55.

The orientation is the conventional one used for TNFa and TNFf3 trimers, with the 3fold axis vertical and the broader part of the TNF trimer at the bottom. In this orientation the peptide chain of sTNF-R55 runs upward, i.e., the N-terminus is at the bottom and the C-terminus is at the top, as shown.

Domain 2 is shown in thick lines, starting at bottom center with Cys52 (the last Cys of domain 1) and ending at top left with Cys-96 (the first Cys of domain 3). Residues Cys-33 to Tyr-40 of loop 2 of domain 1 are shown in dashed lines. This loop interacts with loop 1 of domain 2. Domain 3 is shown in faint lines superposed on domain 2, with loop 1 residues, apart from the structurally important Tyr-103, shown as alanine for clarity. The C, coordinates of residues 100-103, 114-120, 124-l 29, and 132-l 36 of domain 3 superpose on the C. coordinates of residues 57-60, 7076,63-66, and 91-97 of domain 2 with an RMS error of 0.58 A. The domains are remarkably similar apart from the second part of loop 1 (bottom left) and the first part of loop 2 (top right). It may be seen at top left and bottom right that the connections between domains are all different in detail.  apart from the terminal residues, differs from domain 2 in only two places: loop 2 is reduced to a p turn, and the second half of loop 1 forms a strand-turn-strand structure (Figures 5 and 6). The residues critical for folding are maintained, with the conservative replacement of Asn-134 for Asp-93 and Tyr-103 for Phe-60. Domain 1 also has the same disulfide connectivity as domains 2 and 3. The C-terminal part of the domain, residues 30-52, has the same structure as the corresponding part of domains 2 and 3. Residues 32-34,37-41, and 5153 superpose on residues 75-77,62-66, and 95-97 with an RMS deviation of 0.41 A in C, atoms. The Cys-x-x-cysx-x-Cys motif, however, is not exactly conserved in domain 1: there is no intervening residue between the first two cysteines of the motif (Cys-29 and Cys-30). Loop 1 has the same general shape in domain 1 as in the other domains, but is located 7-6 8, higher along the first up-strand because of the 2-residue deletion. The conserved phenylalanine/tyrosine (Tyr-20) at the fifth position in the loop packs not underneath the second disulfide bridge (Cys30-Cys-43) but rather on top of it, pointing in toward the conserved threonine (Thr-50) and stacking against His-66 from loop 1 of domain 2. (The first part of loop 1 of domain 1 can be clearly seen in Figure 48 at the bottom left, reaching up toward the second part of loop 1 of domain 2.) Thr-50 plays the same structural role as in the other domains, but the expected interaction between Asp-49 and Thr31 is absent. The Asp-Thr-Val-Cys motif is not fully conserved in domain 1, where Cys-52 is preceded by Asp. There is also no obvious structural constraint requiring valine at this position. Domain 4 is rather disordered, but it has been possible to build loop 1 as a structure similar to loop 1 of domains 2 and 3. The connectivity of the last two disulfide bridges of domain 4 remains undetermined. The connections between consecutive domains differ from each other in both sequence and structure.

These residues pack against loop 2 of the preceding domain, but the structures differ in detail. As may be seen in Figure 48, domains 2 and 3 are related by a translation of about 30 A along the long axis of the molecule and a rotation of about 45O about this axis, the prominent second part of loop 1 of domain 3 being at the left and the corresponding part of domain 2 being forward and left. Domain 1, however, is rotated 1 80° about the long axis of the molecule relative to domain 2. Despite this, the regular spacing along the molecule of the centers of the disulfide bridges is preserved from the second disulfide bridge of domain 1 to the third of domain 3 (Figure 48). Table 8 lists the interdisulfide bridge distances and angles, measured between the midpoints of the sulfur pairs. The second to eighth sulfur midpoints lie on a smooth curve (approximately the arc of a circle of radius 43 A). Three successive midpoints make an angleof 150°-1 80°. There is no particular side chain packing between the disulfide bridges at the boundaries of domains 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, rather these bridges interact with main chain atoms. The attachment  of domain 4 to domain 3 is somewhat different, as the first disulfide bridge of domain 4 (Cys-139-Cys-150) turns down behind loop 2 of domain 3 and packs against disulfide bridge Cys-120-Cys-137 (Figure 4b). The domains overlap in each case by about the spacing of the disulfide bridges, i.e., 10 A. The overlapping residues come only from loops 1 and 2. The cores of the domains do not overlap but rather are arranged strictly in tandem. Two N-linked glycosylation sites are at Asn-122 and Asn-25, which are at the top and bottom of the molecule, respectively. These residues are exposed and point away from the ligand. The third N-linked glycosylation site at Asn-118 is near the disordered region at the top of the ligand. Incomplete or heterogeneous glycosylation at Asn25 may contribute to the disorder seen in loop 1 of domain 1. Structural Changes on Complex Formation The structural changes on ligand-receptor complex formation are restricted to local rearrangements of surface loops of TNF8, the internal packing of the trimer being accurately preserved. Taking, for example, the same 297 C. atoms used above to compare TNFa and TNF8, it is found that the RMS difference after superposition of the  Cdl 440  Figure 8.

There are, however, two significant change8 in surface features. First, the d-e loop, residues 105-110, adopts a well-defined conformation in the complex, where it interacts with sTNF-R55. Second, residues 46-51 of the a' -a" loop, which also interacts with sTNF-R55, show many changes in main chain and side chain torsion angles, although no C, atom moves by more than 2 A. Asp-50 adopts the unusual, somewhat strained, a conformation (Sibanda et al., 1969). Further changes in the TNFp structure on complex formation do occur, but are either small or of no clear relevance. The c-d loop, residues 8394, is not seen in the uncomplexed structure but is visible in the complex as a poorly ordered helix. Eck et al. (1992) report a similar structure for 1 of their 2 independent uncomplexed TNF6 molecules. There is no direct evidence of the extent to which the structure of sTNF-R55 changes upon complex formation. The molecule may have some flexibility, but there is no indication in the structure for any hinge region at, for example, an interdomain boundary. A relatively rigid, elongated structure of the sTNF-R55 molecule in solution, compati ble  with the dimensions of sTNF-R55 a8 seen in the crystals of the complex, is indicated by the radius of gyration determined by light scattering (D' Arcy et al., 1993; Loetscher et al., 1991 b). The Receptor-Ligand Interface The contacts between ligand and receptor have been analyzed by computing the decrease in solvent-accessible surface area on complex formation. The results are presented in Figure 7. The interface may conveniently be separated into an upper and a lower region, shown separately in Figure 8. In the lower region, receptor residue8 56-73, which form loop 1 of domain 2 plus the first half of the Cys-x-x-Cys-x-x-Cys motif, form an extended structure that bridges across from the A subunit to the C subunit of the ligand. The principal ligand regions involved are the d-e loop of the C subunit, where Tyr-108 plays a central role, and the a-a" region of the A subunit, where Asp-50 is important. The upper contact region involves receptor residue8 77-81 from the beginning of loop 2 of domain 2 and receptor residues 107-l 14 from the second half of loop 1 of domain 3. These bind to a shallow depression  TNF-TNF Receptor Crystal Structure 441  where the A and C ligand subunits come together at the top of the ligand trimer, whose central part is formed by the tops of 8 strands d and e of subunit C and 8 strands c and f of subunit A (Figure 8A). These are flanked by 2 residues from the end of strand g of subunit C (His-150 and Asp-l 52; Figure 8A, front) and the a-a' loop of subunit A(P37-Q40; Figure 8A, rear). The upper and lower regions do not overlap, but rather have a tenuous connection around Lys-75 of the receptor, where the interaction with Gln-40 shows disorder. As shown in Figure 7, the interactions are a mix of hydrophobic and hydrophilic. The upper contact is hydrophobic at its center and more hydrophilic at the edge. The d-e loop is unusually hydrophobic, which may explain its disorder in the uncomplexed ligand, and it makes many hydrophobic interactions with the receptor, whereas the a-a" loop makes more polar contacts. The 33 putative water molecules so far located all lie at the edges of the ligand-receptor contact regions. Discussion We propose that the structure of the TNFP-sTNFR55 complex reflects the activated TNF receptor state at the cell surface. The TNF8-sTNFR55 complex in the crystal shows three elongated sTNFR55 molecules, each binding along the surface groove between two adjacent subunits of the ligand trimer. The long axes of the three sTNFR55 molecules are approximately parallel to each other and to the 3-fold axis of the ligand. The N- and C-termini of the sTNF-R55 molecules protrude beyond the bottom and top of the ligand trimer, respectively. This structure may be transposed to the cell surface such that the three sTNF-R55 molecules become the extracellular regions of three full-length receptors. The 3-fold axis is then normal to the membrane, and the TNF8 trimer is oriented with its narrower top toward the cell. The spacings between the C-termini of the three sTNF-R55 molecules in the complex are such that the transmembrane regions of the full receptors are expected to come into close proximity. Given their size, the cytoplasmic regions of the three receptors would then be expected to come into contact and form a cluster that generates a signal in downstream components of the signal transmission pathway. Receptor clustering as asignal transduction mechanism has been recognized as a general phenomenon among growth factor receptors (for a review see Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990). A number of previous findings indicate that this mechanism also operates in TNFa and TNF8 signaling. First, the trimeric ligand structure in the crystal and in solution suggested three receptor-binding sites (Eck and Sprang, 1989; Eck et al., 1992; Hakoshima and Tomita, 1988; Jones et al., 1989; Loetscher et al., 1991 b). Second, it was found that antibodies directed to the extracellular regions of the two TNF receptor types were able to elicit TNF activities in sensitive cells, suggesting that aggregation (rather than, for example, ligand internalization) of at least two receptor molecules is sufficient for signal transduction across the membrane (Engelmann et al., 1990; Espevik et al., 1989; Gehr et al., 1992; Tartaglia et al., 1991). The lack of agonistic activity of the monova lent  Fab fragment of one of these antibodies, which could, however, be reconstituted upon cross-linking with a second antibody, further supported this conclusion (Engelmann et al., 1990). Third, human TNF receptor deletion mutants have been generated that lack cytoplasmic region sequences and thus are incompetent for signal transduction. Transfected into mouse cells, the truncated receptors suppressed signaling by the endogenous mouse receptors to an extent that correlated with the relative expression levels of the mouse and truncated human receptors, while the same cell transfectants remained equally sensitive to mouse receptor-specific agonistic antibodies (Brakebusch et al., 1992; Tartaglia and Goeddel, 1992). All of these findings are consistent with a mechanism of signal generation at the cell surface where one TNFa or TNF8 trimer binds three receptor molecules, resulting in a ligand-receptor cluster. The 55 kd TNF receptor belongs to a family of receptors for peptide factors that at present encompasses the 75 kd TNF receptor, the low affinity NGF receptor, the CD40, 4-l BB, and OX40 antigens (reviewed by Loetscher et al., 1991a), the Fas antigen (Itoh et al., 1991; Oehm et al., 1992), and the CD27 and CD30 antigens (Camerini et al., 1991; Diirkop et al., 1992). In addition to these receptor-type membrane proteins, viral open reading frames such as Shope fibroma virus T2 encode proteins that also belong to this family (Smith et al., 1990). Each of these polypeptides has a stretch of sequence with 30%-40% identity to sTNF-R55. The sequence similarity is particularly high in the region corresponding to the second and third disulfide loops of domain 1, the whole of domain 2, and the first disulfide loop of domain 3 of sTNF-R55, where all the sequences may be aligned without major insertions or deletions. It is possible to incorporate each of these sequences into the observed three-dimensional model of sTNF-R55 with good conservation of structural features and no obvious conflicts. In particular, there is conservation of the domain boundaries, which implies the same overall extended structure. We therefore expect this part of sTNF-R55 to provide an extremely good model for the structures of the other members of the family. With two exceptions (Fas and 4-lBB), loop 1 of domain 1 is also clearly present. Domain 4 of sTNF-R55 is, however, atypical, as five of the other proteins of the family have in their fourth domain a sequence, and presumably structure, similar to domain 2 of sTNF-R55. The receptor-binding regions of the ligand have been mapped in a large number of mutation studies (for example, Goh et al., 1991; van Ostade et al., 1991; Yamagishi et al., 1990). The results of these studies identify the loop regions a-a" and d-e as containing the most important receptor contacts. Most mutations were done in TNFa, and the specificity of the mutations for TNF-R55 or TNFR75 was not investigated, as receptor type-specific assays were not available at the time. The results are thus not unambiguously transferable to the TNF8-TNF-R55 system. However, the fact that all mutational analyses of binding of TNF ligands to TNF receptors identify contact regions found in the TNFf.%-sTNF-R55 complex leads us to conclude that all four of the possible complexes of TNFa  Cdl 442  and TNFj3 with the two TNF receptors are likely to have closely similar structures. A certain degree of structural adaptation of receptor and ligand to each other, as demonstrated for TNFj3 in the formation of the TNFjS-sTNF-R55 complex, must also occur in the formation of the other complexes. The structural changes involved, however, would appear to be small and local. The major structural event in the formation of the active receptor complex seems to be the bringing together of receptor molecules rather than, for instance, the induction of some kind of conformational switch. Another receptor system in which a detailed structural model is available is provided by a member of the hematopoietic factor receptor family. De Vos et al. (1992) have recently reported the crystal structure of the complex of human growth hormone with the soluble fragment of its receptor. In this complex, a single monomeric growth hormone molecule binds two receptor molecules to form the cluster, which is thought to generate the signal (Fuh et al., 1992). The same residues of the two receptor molecules interact with two different sites on the ligand molecule and are thus not strictly symmetrically equivalent. This contrasts with the exact 3-fold symmetry of the TNFp-sTNF-R55 complex. It is, however, quite possible that the formation of a tworeceptor cluster may be sufficient for TNF signal generation. Experimental Procedures Recombinant Expresslon and Purification RecombinantTNF6 and sTNF-RCBwere expressed in E. coli and baculovirus-Sf9 expression systems, respectively, and purified as previously reported (Loetscher et al., 1991b; Schoenfeld et al., 1991).  Eck et al. (1992) recently reported similar success with a truncated TNF6 in a different crystal form. The model of the uncomplexed TNF5 structure was later refined to a final R factor of 15% at 3.2 A resolution. The structure of the TNF6-sTNF-R55 complex was solved using the heavy atom MIR method. Crystals were harvested by slowly adding 20% PEG4000, 400 mM MgClr, 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 5.5) to the drops (as direct transfer cracks the crystals) and were soaked overnight in 2 mM solutions of heavy atoms in this buffer. Rotation data (7O-loo) were collected for each surviving crystal. This was found sufficient to index the crystal and to provide enough data to determine whether it was a potential derivative. Difference Patterson syntheses were computed in space group Pmmm and solved independently. for iridium hexachloride, platinum hexaiodide, and gold tetrachloride, determining the space group as 123. Heavy atoms were refined using the centric data and brought to a common origin, and phases were computed that were used to solve two further derivatives, terpyridyl platinum and uranyl acetate. The derivatives were all independent, and each was refined against phases computed from the other derivatives. Table 4 shows the phasing power of the different derivatives. It can be seen that the gold chloride derivative is extremely good, and this and the terpyridyl platinum were used to compute phases to 3.2 8, resolution, with the anomalous scattering information for both derivatives included in the standard way. These phases were improved using the solvent flatteqing programs available in the CCP4 package. Phase extension to 3 A resolution using solvent flattening was performed in 6 cycles but brought little improvement. The corresponding electron density was used for interpretation. The heavy atom derivatives were reviewed when refined model phases were available. The uranyl acetate derivative is poorly isomorphous. The other four heavy atoms bind independently to seven different histidine side chains. One gold site is located internally between two histidines, and the other site is on the protein surface. The terpyridyl platinum binds to surface histidines with a neighboring hydrophobic side chain. The iridium hexachloride binds on the 3-fold axis but disturbs the structure locally, and the platinum hexaiodide has a double site with a pearshaped appearance. Both the latter derivatives are understood with hindsight to carry significant phase information out to at least 4 A resolution but are difficult to model in practice.  Crystalllzetlon Crystals of TNF5 and of TNF6 complexed to sTNFR55 were grown as described (D' Arcy et al., 1993). In brief, the hanging drop vapor diffusion method was used (McPherson, 1976). The final reservoir buffer for TNF6 was 25% PEG40CQ 200 mM ammonium acetate, 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.2). The final reservoir buffer for the complex was 15% PEG4000, 200-400 mM MgCIr, 2% 5-octyl glucoside, 100 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 5.5).  Electron Denslty Interpretation, the Structure  Refinement, and Analysis of  Diffraction Measurements and Data Processing Data were collected on a NicoleVXentronics area detector mounted on an Elliot GX21 rotating copper anode X-ray generator operated at 40 kV, 75 mA with a 0.3 mm focal spot and a graphite monochromator. Data frames were processed on a VAX9000 computer (Digital Equipment Corporation) using the XDS primary data reduction program (Kabsch, 1966). Unit cells and possible space groups were determined by converting the reciprocal space reflection positions found by XDS to pseudoatoms and examining the pattern and estimating cell constants using FRODO (Jones, 1965) on an Evans and Sutherland PS390 graphics station. Further data reduction and manipulation were performed using the CCP4 crystallographic package (The Science and Engineering Research Council' Collaborative s Computing Project Number 4, A Suite of Programs for Protein Crystallography, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, England, 1979).  lnltlal Phase Determlnatlon The TNF6 structure was solved by molecular replacement using the MERLOT package (Fitzgerald, 1966; see also Crowther, 1972; Lattman and Love, 1972) with the model of TNFa (Eck and Sprang, 1969; entry 1TNF in the Protein Data Bank, Bernstein et al., 1977). Table 2 lists the important parameters. A preliminary simulated annealing run using X-PLOR (Briinger et al., 1967) gave a useful starting model that facilitated the interpretation of the electron density of the complex.  Electron density fitting was performed using FRODO on an Evans and Sutherland PS390graphicsstation. Refinement used theX-PLOR program, version 2.1 (Briinger, 1990; Briinger et al., 1967) on IRIS 4D series work stations (Silicon Graphics Incorporated). X-PLOR was run as suggested in the user manual but with the weight on the X-ray terms reduced to 40% of that found in the check stage. Analysis of the structure and production of diagrams used 0 version 5.7 (Jones et al., 1991) X-PLOR, MOLDC (P. R. Gerber and K. Miiller, unpublished data), RIBBONS (Carson, 1967) and RIBBON (Priestle, 1966) on IRIS 4D series work stations. Solvent accessibility was computed using specially written programs based on the algorithm of Lee and Richards (1971). A probe radius of 1.4 A was always used. For the area of contact between two molecules, the value quoted is the mean of the differences in solvent accessibility of the two surfaces, the differences being computed between the complexed and uncomplexed states. A preliminary TNF5 trimer model was placed by hand in the electron density of the TNF5-sTNF-R55 complex. It was found useful to skeletalize the electron density for this purpose, using either the BONES option in 0 or the RIDGE program delivered with FRODO, both of which use the algorithm of Greer (1974). The electron density corresponding to sTNF-R55 remained to be interpreted, which initially proved quite difficult. Clearly, some of the disulfide bridges had to be identified. Several candidates were found, but the main chain was hard to trace; its direction could not be determined, as the carbonyl bumps could not be seen and side chains could not be assigned with any certainty (one of the better regions is shown in Figure 2A). To help in pattern recognition, we took well-determined data bank structures (5EBX, Corfield et al., 1969; SWGA, Wright, 1990; Bernstein et al., 1977) computed structure factors, and degraded their amplitudes until the disulfide bridge electron densities were of similar quality to those of the TNF6-sTNF-R55 complex. A resolution cutoff of 3.3 A and an increase in atomic B values of 200 AZ was appropriate.  TNF-TNF 443  Receptor Crystal f%JCtUre  It was most informative to see that at this resolution either the electron density is weak or negative at the cysteine CII positions and/or main chain connectivity is lost between a cysteine and the preceding residue (see Figure 2A). Furthermore, the disulfides do not always have electron density higher than the other features in the map. With this aid to pattern recognition, a disulfide bridge was identified with some confidence and the backbone traced from it in all four directions. Side chains were hard to identify, but two chain ends could be connected to give a loop of 16 residues, which was provisionally assigned to residues 55-70 (see Figures 1B and 2) and confirmed by extension to Cys-52 and Cys-76. Figure 2A shows that the 73-88 disulfide has weaker electron density than the hydrogen-bonded bridge from Asp-93 to Ser-74, making interpretation difficult. Once domain 2 had been completed, the model was used to locate domains 1 and 3 by visual comparison with the skeletalized electron density. A first positional refinement using TNF5 residues 28-l 71 and sTNFR55 residues 28-141 and reflections in the resolution range 6-3.2 A took the R factor from 40.4% to 26.3% (see Table 5) indicating that the start structure was reliable but also that the rest of the structure was likely rather weak. The model was then extended to Cys-15 in the N-terminal direction and to Cys-150 in the C-terminal direction, with residues 22-27 and 144-149 having poorly defined side chain positions, although the main chain density is continuous. Somewhat clearer electron density was obtained in the region of the N-and C-termini of sTNFR55 and the carbohydrate antennae by using phase combination out to a resolution of 4 A but suppressing the calculated structure factor contribution at low resolution by heavilyweighting the MIR contribution at 25-6 A. The presence of carbohydrate at the predicted positions could be confirmed, but the carbohydrate chains and the missing amino acids were not clear enough to model. Electron density runs beyond Cys-150 toward a point in the unit cell where four 3-fold axes intersect, but it has not yet been possible to assign sequence to this density. Two further rounds of model building and positional refinement took the R factor to 28.1% for data to 2.85 A resolution. Constrained B value refinement reduced the R factor to 23%, a larger drop than normal, occurring because the sTNF-R55 has much higher temperature factors than the TNFf3. Two independent simulated annealing runs were then performed, heating to 3500°C and 4000°C. The resulting models were largely consistent in the better-defined regions and were most useful in suggesting improved local conformations of the model but did not help to improve the poorly defined regions. Simulated annealing was not incorporated directly into the refinement path, as it was feared that it would effectively eliminate the poorer regions. The current R factor is 18.8% with good geometry (Table 5). The geometric mean B value is 17.7 k for the C. atoms of TNFf3 and 42.5 A2 for the C. atoms of sTNF-R55. The algorithm of Liithy et al. (1992) which analyzes the local environment of each amino acid, was used to check for possible errors in the structure. A 3D-1 D score was produced for each amino acid and averaged over 21 consecutive amino acids to give a parameter that is around 0.4 for correctly folded protein regions and around 0 for incorrect regions. The values calculated for the final model average 0.45 for the complex, 0.44 for the isolated ligand trimer, 0.38 for the isolated receptor, and 0.36 for the ligand monomer. Two regions of the complex have average values of around 0.2: the d-e loop of the ligand and the receptor sequence around 119-121 (Leu-Cys-Leu). Both have values around 0.05 when the receptor is separated from the ligand. The other ligand-receptor contact areas also give higher values on complex formation. An analysis of local backbone conformation using the 0 program indicates good compatibility with the data base of well-refined protein structures. One ambiguous conformation around the partially disordered Gln-40 of the ligand may have to be revised. The 0 program was used further to compute a real space fit for each residue. This parameter, which may vary from -1 to +l, gives the correlation between the local electron density and the density calculated from the current model. We find that this parameter reflects very accurately the subjective interpretability of the electron density. For the final model of the complex, mean values of 0.79 for the ligand and 0.71 for the receptor are obtained. Individual values in the 0.3-0.5 range are found at the beginning of loop 1 of domain 1 of the receptor and in domain 4 of the receptor. Otherwise this analysis supports the model. Comparisons, both visual and using this parameter, of the final  model with a range of different electron densities produced at all stages of the structure determination (unpublished data) were most informative, indicating, for instance, that the inclusion of the anomalous scattering data had a significant beneficial effect, that the initial electron density suffered from the incompleteness of the highest resolution data of the gold derivative, and that solvent flattening gave significant improvement but phase extension did not. Furthermore, when the final refined model of the uncomplexed ligand was used to phase the data of the complex, the density produced was extremely good, in fact, better than the MIR density. In particular, the SIGMAA coefficients of Read (1986) used with Q = 2 (Stuart and Artymiuk. 1985) gave for the receptor a real space fit of 0.53, as compared with 0.45 from the MIR phases. Phase combination of the two gives values of 0.6 for the receptor and 0.74 for the ligand. We conclude that for protein complexes such as this, it is extremely valuable to determine independently the structure of either component when this is practical. The fit of the final model to the data was further analyzed by computing the free R value (Briinger, 1992) using version 3.1 of X-PLOR when this became available. Three simulated annealing runs, heating to 3500°C, 3500°C, and4000°C, followed by positional refinement, gave for the working set of 9384 reflections R values of 20.5%, 20.3%, and 20.0%, and for the test set of 1077 reflections 25.2%, 24.3%, and 23.7%. We regard this as clear confirmation of the correctness of the model. Atomic coordinates have been deposited at the Brookhaven data bank for release after 1 year.

						<Abstract>The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. Elf-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.</Abstract>

Cell. Biol. 6, 2895 (1986)].  (1 990).  The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that regulates cell cycle progression. El-1 is a lymphoid-specific Ets transcription factor that regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. In this report, it is demonstrated that Elf-1 contains a sequence motif that is highly related to the Rb binding sites of several viral oncoproteins and binds to the pocket region of Rb both in vitro and in vivo. Elf-1 binds exclusively to the underphosphorylated form of Rb and fails to bind to Rb mutants derived from patients with retinoblastoma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an association between Elf-1 and Rb in resting normal human T cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the release of Elf-1, which is correlated temporally with the activation of Elf-1-mediated transcription. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective form of Rb inhibited Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. These results demonstrate that Rb interacts specifically with a lineage-restricted Ets transcription factor. This regulated interaction may be important for the coordination of lineage-specific effector functions such as lymphokine production with cell cycle progression in activated T cells.  T lymphocyte activation and proliferation in response to signaling through the cell surface T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is a model system for studies of cell cyclespecific transcriptional regulation (1). Resting peripheral blood T cells remain in GO until they encounter an antigen-presenting cell that displays a specific antigenic peptide in conjunction with the appropriate SCIENCE * VOL. 260 * 28 MAY 1993  major histocompatibility complex molecule. Antigenic stimulation results in the transcriptional induction of more than 100 new genes, many of which are specific to T cells (1). Antigen-stimulated T cells progress through the cell cycle and proliferate concomitantly with these changes in gene expression.

Hyperrecombination is a specific feature of the A-T phenotype rather than a generic consequence of defective DNA repair in that an XP cell line (which is defective in excision repair) exhibited normal spontaneous recombination rates [Table 1 and (13)1. Elevated spontaneous rates of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes in vivo could help contribute to the high incidence of cancer in A-T patients by causing loss of heterozygosity at recessive oncogene loci, a key genetic event in tumorigenesis. Several hypotheses have been offered to explain the pleiotropic A-T phenotype, including defects in DNA recombination and repair (5, 7, 8, 22), unusual chromatin or cytoskeletal structure (23, 24), and cell cycle abnormalities (23, 25). Our findings of high spontaneous recombination rates are not consistent with an inability to productively rearrange DNA but may result from defects in damage-sensitive cell cycle checkpoints (23, 26) that allow A-T cells to replicate DNA or enter mitosis before repair of spontaneous DNA damage is complete. These same checkpoint defects could cause aberrant immune gene rearrangements by allowing DNA replication or mitosis to disrupt switch recombination and TCR gene rearrangement, leading to selective Ig deficiencies and low frequencies of T cells expressing a/l3 TCRs as well as a high frequency of T cells with interlocus TCRs and chromosome translocations.  10. Single copy cell lines were identified as follows: A series of single digests with Hind Ill, Xba I, and Xho were carried out on genomic DNAs from hphR cell lines that had been transformed with pNeoA. These restriction enzymes cut the integrated vector once at sites that lie between its two neo genes. Cell lines whose genomic DNA exhibited only two junction fragments containing rev sequence when digested with these enzymes and analyzed by Southern blotting were considered to contain single copies of pNeoA. Additional digests were performed with appropriate enzymes to ensure that multiple copies of the vector had not integrated in a single array nor had they yet undergone rearrangement. Cell lines containing single copies of the pLrec vector were identified in a similar manner. 11. S. E. Luria and M. Delbruck, Genetics 28, 491 (1943); R. L. Capizzi and J. W. Jameson, Mutat.

Amino acid se(32) of the Rb binding site of human Elf-1. The bottom panel is a schematic illustration of the 619-amino acid human Elf-1 protein (5). Amino acid (aa) numbers are shown below the map. The main  S  tion factors (2) regulate inducible gene expression in T cells (3-8). Purine-rich motifs corresponding to the consensus Ets binding site (2) are required for the transcriptional induction of multiple activation-specific T cell genes, including the interleukin-2 (IL-2) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) genes (5, 8), and several inducible T cell trophic viruses including human immunodeficiency virus-type 2 (HIV-2) (6), murine sarcoma virus (3), and human T cell leukemia virus I (4). We have cloned a member of the Ets family, Elf-1 (5), that binds specifically to purine-rich sites in the IL-2, GM-CSF, and HIV-2 enhancers that are required for the transcriptional induction of these genes after T cell activation (5, 8). These studies strongly suggest that Elf-i regulates inducible gene expression during T cell activation. However, the mechanisms that underlie Elf-l-dependent transcriptional activation in T cells remained unclear because Northern (RNA) and protein immunoblot analyses showed equal amounts of Elf-1 mRNA (5) and protein (9) in resting and activated normal human T cells. Rb negatively regulates the G1 to S transition of the cell cycle (10). Unphosphorylated Rb accumulates during GO and G1 and binds to at least eight cellular nuclear proteins (1 1, 12), including RBP- 1 and RBP-2 [whose functions remain unknown (13)1, and c-Myc (14) and E2F (11, 15), transcription factors that are known to regulate cell cycle-specific gene expression. Rb is phosphorylated during the G1 to S transition (16). This phosphorylation event results in the dissociation of Rb from its cellular binding proteins (11, 12). The pocket region of unphosphorylated Rb (amino acids 379 to 792) also binds at least three viral oncoproteins, SV40 large T antigen (TAg) (17), adenovirus EiA (18), and human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 (19). Part of the oncogenic potential of these viral proteins may result from their ability to competitively dissociate Rb from its cellular binding proteins (11, 12). An examination of the predicted amino acid sequence of Elf-1 (5) revealed the presence of sequence motifs similar to the Rb binding domains of TAg, E1A, and HPV E7 (17, 19). The putative Rb binding site of Elf-1 is located at the NH2-terminus of the protein (amino acids 21 to 72) (Fig. 1) and partially C.-Y. Wang and J. M.

An acidic transcriptional transactivation domain is located between amino acids 55 and 100. The putative Rb binding site is shown by the hatched box centered around amino acid 55. The upper panel shows a comparison of the amino acid sequences of the putative Rb binding site of human Elf-1 with the known Rb binding sites of adenovirus E1A, SV40 large TAg, and the HPV E7 protein (17-19).  overlaps a highly acidic region (amino acids 55 to 100) that can function as a potent transcriptional activator domain when fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL-4 (9). The presence of a putative Rb binding site in Elf-1 suggested that regulated interactions of Elf-1 with Rb might represent an important mechanism for controlling transcription and cell cycle progression during T cell activation. To test whether Elf-1 can interact specifically with Rb in vitro, we bound a recombinant glutathione-S-transferase-Rb (GSTRb) fusion protein containing the pocket region of Rb (amino acids 379 to 928) to glutathione-Sepharose and used the resulting beads as an affinity reagent for [35S1Elf-1 protein translated in vitro. The pocket region of Rb used in this fusion protein binds to SV40 TAg, E1A, HPV E7, and several cellular proteins (17-21). The GST-RbSepharose beads bound a 97-kD protein corresponding in size to the full-length Elf-1 protein translated in vitro (Fig. 2A). In control experiments performed to demonstrate the specificity of the Elf- 1-Rb interaction, in vitro-translated Elf-1 failed to bind to GST-Sepharose (Fig. 2A). In addition, the Elf-i-related transcription factor Ets-1 (22), which contains a highly related DNA binding domain but lacks the putative Rb binding site present in Elf-1, also failed to bind to GST-Rb-Sepharose (9). Several naturally occurring, loss-offunction alleles of Rb have been isolated from patients with retinoblastoma. Most stable variants contain mutations or deletions in the pocket region of Rb and fail to bind SV40 TAg, E1A, and HPV E7 (20, 23). Three of these Rb variants, containing a deletion of exon 22 (GST-RbdlEx22), a deletion of exon 21 (GST-RbdlEx2 1), or a point mutation resulting in a single amino acid substitution (Cys706 to Phe) (GSTRbA706), failed to bind in vitro-translated Elf-1 (Fig. 2A). SCIENCE *  To determine whether the Rb binding site in Elf-1 corresponded to the NH2terminal sequence that is similar to the Rb binding sites of the viral oncoproteins, we  produced a mutant form of recombinant Elf-1 in which the highly conserved amino acids Leu5t, Cys53, and Glu55 were changed to Arg, Arg, and His, respectively. This mutant Elf- 1 protein failed to bind to GSTRb-Sepharose (Fig. 2B). A truncated version of Elf-1 lacking amino acids 1 to 108 also failed to bind to GST-Rb-Sepharose (9). The observed differences in Rb binding were not a result of differences in translational efficiencies because equal amounts of in vitro-translated wild-type and mutant Elf-1 proteins, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), were used in each binding reaction. In vitro binding experiments were also performed with recombinant GST-Elf- 1 fusion protein bound to Sepharose and in vitro-translated [35S]Rb. In vitro-translated Rb bound efficiently to GST-Elf-1Sepharose but failed to bind to GST-Sepharose (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in vitro-translated RbA706 containing a point mutation that inactivates viral oncoprotein binding failed to bind to the GST-Elf-1-Sepharose. To determine directly if the HPV E7related region of Elf-1 contained the Rb binding site, we attempted to compete away the binding of in vitro-translated Elf-1 to GST-Rb-Sepharose with a peptide corresponding to the Rb binding domain of the HPV E7 protein (19) (Fig. 2D). For a negative control, we used a mutant E7 peptide containing a single amino acid substitution (Glu to Gln). The wild-type E7 peptide completely inhibited the binding of in vitro-translated [35S]Elf-1 to Rb (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the mutant peptide had little if any effect on the binding. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that Elf-1 binds specifically to Rb in vitro and that this interaction is mediated by the 1331  VOL. 260  *  28 MAY 1993  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on November 6, 2009  .......  1  ........  ....

The Rb protein is differentially phosphorylated during cell cycle progression (16). In GO and G1, an unphosphorylated or underphosphorylated form of Rb predominates. Rb becomes highly phosphorylated at the G1 to S transition and is subsequently converted to the underphosphorylated form after mitosis. The underphosphorylated form of Rb binds preferentially to the viral oncoproteins (17). To determine whether Elf-1 could bind to Rb from cell extracts, COS cell (24) extracts were incubated with GST-Elf-1-Sepharose, the beads were washed, and the bound proteins were eluted and resolved by SDSPAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitro cellulose  and subjected to protein immunoblot analyses with the Rb monoclonal antibody (mAb) G3-245 (Fig. 3A). As described previously, COS cell extracts contained several forms of Rb with molecular sizes between 110 and 116 kD (16, 17). The band with the fastest mobility (pRb) represents underphosphorylated Rb, whereas the slower mobility bands (pRbIcss) represent multiple, hyperphosphorylated forms of the protein (16, 17, 25). Incubation of COS cell extracts with immobilized GST-Elf-1 resulted in the preferential retention of pRb (Fig. 3A). No binding of pRbPl°s to Elf- 1 was observed despite the fact that (as would be expected in extracts from exponentially growing COS cells) the majority of the Rb protein was hyperphosphorylated. In addition, no Rb protein bound to GST-Sepha-. rose alone, again demonstrating the specific ity  of the Elf-1-Rb interaction. These results show that Elf-1 binds preferentially to the underphosphorylated form of Rb. Two types of experiments were performed to determine if Elf-1 and Rb interact in vivo.

The Elf-i antiserum co-immunoprecipitated the underphosphorylated form of Rb (Fig. 3B). This coprecipitation reflected a specific in teraction  between Elf-1 and Rb because it was not observed with preimmune serum from the same rabbit. We also attempted to demonstrate a regulated interaction between Rb and Elf-i in normal human peripheral blood T cells.

The unphosphorylated Rb in resting T cells was co-immunoprecipitated with Elf-1. In contrast, after T cell activation, most of the Rb became hyperphosphorylated and was no longer associated with Elf-1 (Fig. 4). Thus, the hyperphosphorylation of Rb during normal human T cell activation is associated with the disruption of the Elf-i-Rb complexes present in resting T cells. Elf-1 binds to a site in the GM-CSF promoter that is required for the inducible expression of the GM-CSF gene during T cell activation (Fig. 5) (26). A chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter construct, which contained three copies of the wild-type GM-CSF Elf-1 binding site (Fig. 5A) that were cloned 5' of a minimal SV40 promoter, was induced 35-fold after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin stimulation of Jurkat human T cells. Mutations of the Elf-1 binding site in this oligonucleotide (mGM-CSF; Fig. 5A) that abolished Elf-1 binding (Fig. 5B) also abolished the inducibility of CAT expression after T cell activation (Fig. 5C). Thus, the GM-CSFCAT reporter plasmid can be used as an assay system for Elf-1-dependent transcription during T cell activation. To determine the effect of overexpression of Rb on Elf-l-dependent transcriptional activation, we cotransfected Jurkat T cells with the GM-CSFCAT reporter plasmid and an expression vector encoding a mutant form of Rb (Ap34-HA) that cannot be phosphorylated during cell cycle progression but retains the ability to bind viral oncoproteins such as TAg and E1A (27). These transfected cells were then activated by treatment with PMA and ionomycin. We used the phosphorylation-defective form of Rb because it should bind constitutively to Elf-1 even after T cell activation with PMA and ionomycin and because previous studies have shown that this mutant Rb is a potent inhibitor of adenovirus EIIaE promoter-dependent transcription (27). Overexpression of the phosphorylation-defective Rb protein reproducibly inhibited Elf-l-dependent transcriptional activation by more than 85% (Fig. 5C). In contrast, like overexpression of a wild-type Rb expression vector (9), overexpression of a control Rb expression vector encoding the AF706 mutant form of Rbu that fails to bind to Elf- 1 had little effect on the inducibility of the GM-CSF reporter 1333  111all  onw.t~  [a~ .....  m ...: 9Rg~  WIMPARAM  venting  important protein-protein interactions mediated by this region of Elf-1. Although the data presented in this report are consistent with a model in which the binding of Rb to Elf- 1 in resting T cells inhibits its transcriptional activation function, the mechanism by which Rb regulates Elf-i-dependent transcription in T cells may be more complex. Rb is capable of binding to DNA in concert with the cellular transcription factor E2F, and cyclin A is able to bind specifically to the E2F-Rb complex (11, 15). Similarly, Rb can form stable complexes with cyclins D2 and D3 and cdk4 (28). Moreover, there are additional proteins that bind to the Rb binding sites of TAg, E1A, and E7 (17, 19, 29). These include the Rb-related protein piO7, which has been cloned (30), as well as p300. Finally, we have recently reported that Elf-1 can bind to DNA in  conjunction  with specific  mem bers  of the AP-1 family of transcription factors (3 1). Thus, a complete under1334  SCIENCE  *  VOL. 260  *  28 MAY 1993  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on November 6, 2009  plasmid (Fig. 5C). The inhibitory effect of the phosphorylation-defective Rb protein was specific for Elf-l-dependent transcription because it had no effect on transcription from the pRSVIgal reference plasmid that was included in each transfection (9). Previous studies have suggested that Elf-1 functions to regulate inducible gene expression in T cells (5, 8). However, the finding of equal amounts of Elf-1 mRNA and protein in resting and activated T cells raised important questions about how Elf-1 could function in an activationspecific context (5). To determine the basis of this apparent discrepancy, we examined the association of Elf-1 with other transcriptional regulatory proteins. Here, we have shown that Elf-1 forms complexes with the underphosphorylated form of Rb both in vitro and in vivo and that overexpression of unphosphorylated Rb inhibits Elf- i-dependent transcriptional activation in T cells. These results are consistent with a model in which underphosphorylated Rb in resting T cells sequesters or inactivates Elf-1, thereby rendering it unable to activate gene expression in these cells. After T cell activation, the phosphorylation of Rb results in the dissociation of the Elf-i-Rb complex, allowing Elf-1 to bind to and activate the expression of genes such as GMCSF and HIV-2. In this model, Rb could inhibit Elf-1 function by preventing its DNA binding, inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the DNA-bound Elf- 1, or both. The finding that the Rb binding domain is directly adjacent to an acidic transcriptional transactivator domain of Elf- 1 is consistent with the hypothesis that Rb binding inhibits the activity of this transactivating domain, possibly by pre standing  of the regulation of Elf-i-dependent transcription during T cell activation awaits a more detailed description of the regulated interactions between Elf-1, Rb, related pocket proteins such as pi07 and p300, AP-1, and associated cyclins and kinases in normal T cells. The results presented here suggest that regulated interactions between Rb and the lineagerestricted transcription factor Elf-1 modulate inducible gene expression during T cell activation. Thus, Rb appears to integrate the regulation of lineage-specific effector functions with cell cycle progression during T cell activation. REFERENCES AND NOTES 1. G. R.

The pGST-Rb plasmid encoding a glutathioneS-transferase-Rb (amino acids 379 to 928) fusion protein has been described previously, as have variants of this plasmid encoding GST-Rb fusion proteins containing deletions of exon 21 or exon 22 (11, 12). GST-RbA706 contains a point mutation of Rb at amino acid 706 (Cys to Phe) (11, 12). pGST-Elf-1 contains the fulllength human Elf-1 complementary DNA (cDNA) (5) cloned into the Sma site of pGEX-3X (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). pcDNA1/NEOElf-1 contains the full-length human Elf-1 cDNA cloned into the Eco RV and Xho sites of pcDNA1/NEO (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The pSG5-Rb plasmid contains the full-length human Rb cDNA cloned into the Bam HI site of pSG5 (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA). pSG5-RbA706 is identical to pSG5-Rb except for a point mutation at amino acid 706 of Rb (Cys to Phe). A mutant form of Elf-1 containing three amino acid substitutions (Leu51 to Arg, Cys53 to Arg, and Glu55 to His) was produced with polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis as described (8) with the synthetic oligonucleotides GCCGGTCGGGCCCGTGTGCACGAGCCCAATGACATGATTACTGAGAGTTC (5' primer) and GGGCTCGTGCACACGGGCCCGACCGGCATAACTATTGAGAATATCAGCACCAGG (3' primer). The mutant Elf-1 cDNA was cloned into the Eco RV and Xho sites of pcDNA1/NEO to produce pcDNA1/NEO-mElf-1. The pGMCSFCAT reporter plasmid contains three copies of the Elf-1 binding site from the human GM-CSF promoter (bp -33 to -63) cloned into the Sma site upstream of the minimal SV40 promoter and the CAT cassette in pSPCAT (5). The pcDNAAp34-HA plasmid contains the murine Rb cDNA mutated at eight possible phosphorylation sites cloned into the Eco RV site of pcDNA1/NEO (Invitrogen) (27). In vitro transcription and translation reactions were carried out with commercially available kits (Promega) as described (8). Before the binding reactions, 10 pl of in vitro translation mixture was diluted in 700 gl of NETN [20 mM tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCI, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% NP-40]. For GST fusion protein production, overnight cultures of Escherichia coli DH5a containing the pGEX-3X, pGST-Rb, or pGST-Elf-1 plasmids were diluted 1:10 in Luria broth and grown for 1 hour with shaking at 37°C. lsopropyl-P-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM, and cultures were incubated at 370C for 4 hours with shaking. Bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in NETN. After incubation at 40C for 30 min, the cells were sonicated three times for 15 s on ice. For the in vitro binding assays, glutathioneSepharose beads (Pharmacia) were washed three times in NETN plus 0.5% powdered milk. We bound GST fusion proteins to the glutathione-Sepharose by incubating 1 ml of crude bacterial extract with 30 gi of Sepharose beads  1M.P  R ZZI-R  MW  ..............  ...............  ....  .......  ......................  for 30 min at 4TC. The beads were washed three times with NETN and incubated with 700 1l of radiolabeled, in vitro-translated protein in NETN at 40C for 1 hour. The beads were washed five times in NETN, and the proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer [2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 60 mM tris (pH 6.8)]. For peptide competition experiments, 2 &amp;gt;g of wildtype or mutant E7 peptide was included in each binding assay. 34. COS cells were grown on 100 mM tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FCS). We transfected cells with 10 [g of the pcDNA1INEO-Elf-1 plasmid containing the full-length human Elf-1 cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter using lipofectin (BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by incubation for 15 min at 40C in EBC buffer [50 mM tris (pH 8.0), 120 mM NaCI, 0.5% NP-40, 0.1 mM aprotinin, 1 mM leupeptin, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride]. Before their use in binding reactions and immunoprecipitations, the cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation in a microfuge at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 40C. For immunoprecipitations, 300 gl of COS cell extract or 400 li of normal T cell extract was mixed with 700 gl of NETN and 10 pi of Elf-1 antiserum or preimmune serum and incubated for 1 hour at 40C. Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) was washed three times with 4% bovine serum albumin in NETN. Protein A-Sepharose (30 pi) was added to each immunoprecipitation reaction and incubated for 45 min at 4°C. The beads were washed five times with NETN, and the proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For the protein immunoblot experiments, Rb and Elf-1 proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in 7.5% SDS gels (11, 12). Protein immunoblots were probed with the Rb mAb G3-245 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) or Elf-1 antiserum produced by five sequential immunizations of a rabbit with purified recombinant Elf-1 protein. This antiserum immunoprecipitated Elf-1 but failed to immunoprecipitate other Ets family members, including Ets-1, Ets-2, GA binding protein a, and PU. 1. It immunoprecipitates a single major protein of 97 kD from normal human T cells and from Jurkat cells, which corresponds in size to that of in vitro-translated Elf-1. It does not directly immunoprecipitate Rb. The second antibody was commercially available horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat antibody to mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) or goat antibody to rabbit 1g (BRL). 35. Normal human T cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation from buffy coats obtained from normal volunteers as described (31). All preparations used in these studies contained more than 95% lymphocytes as assessed by staining with Wright's stain. Human T cells were cultured at a density of 2 x 1 06 cells/mI in either RPMI + 10% FCS or activated by culturing in RPMI + 10% FCS + PMA (10 ng/ml) + ionomycin (0.5 gg/ml) for 24 to 48 hours before harvesting. T cell extracts were prepared in EBC buffer as described above (400 x 106 cells per 0.5 ml of EBC buffer). 36. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out as described (5) with 32P-labeled double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild-type (GATCGTCACElf-1 binding sites from the GM-CSF promoter. 37. Human Jurkat T cell tumor cells were cultured in RPMI + 10% FCS and transfected with DEAEdextran as described previously (5). All transfections contained 4 pg of reporter plasmid and 1 pg of the pRSVpgal reference plasmid. Cells were cultured for 36 hours after transfection and then, when indicated, activated by treatment with PMA (40 ng/ml) + ionomycin (1.4 gg/ml) for 8 to 10 hours at 37"C. Cells were harvested and extracts assayed for CAT and P-galactosidase activity as  described (5). All transfections were repeated at least three times. 38. We thank D. Livingston, J. Lowe, M.

Although two receptor types, the type I and type 11 receptors, have been implicated in TGF-f3-induced signaling, it is unclear how the many activities of TGF-P are mediated through these receptors. With the use of cells overexpressing truncated type 11 receptors as dominant negative mutants to selectively block type 11 receptor signaling, the existence of two receptor pathways was shown. The type 11 receptors, possibly in conjunction with type I receptors, mediate the induction of growth inhibition and hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product pRB. The type I receptors are responsible for effects on extracellular matrix, such as the induction of fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and for increased JunB expression. Selective inactivation of the type 11 receptors alters the TGF-P response in a similar manner to the functional inactivation of pRB, suggesting a role for pRB in the type 11, but not the type 1, receptor pathway.  CATTAATCATTTCCTCTAACTGT) or mutant (GATCGTCACCATTAATCATTTGGCATAACTGT)  ToF- is a secreted protein that inhibits proliferation of many cell types, regulates the expression of extracellular matrix proteins and their integrin receptors, and is considered an important physiological regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation (1, 2). Cross-linking experiments have revealed that most cells have three types of TGF-13 receptors at the cell surface. The type III receptor (or betaglycan) is a proteoglycan with a short cytoplasmic domain (3, 4) and is not likely to mediate any of the known biological activities of TGF- (57). The type II receptor has recently been cloned, and its sequence indicates that it is a serine-threonine kinase (8). Both type I and type II receptors have been implicated in mediating the biological activities of TGF- (5-7, 9). Complementation studies with mutant mink lung epithelial cell lines (MvlLu) resistant to growth suppression by TGF-,B indicated that the type I receptors or both type I and type II receptors are necessary for all tested biological responses to TGF- (5-7). In complementation analyses using different cell hybrids, increased type II receptor expression was associated with growth suppression but not induction of several matrix proteins (9). However, the concomitant increase in type I receptor levels in this study (9) and the possible interaction between these two receptor Department of Growth and Development and Department of Anatomy, Programs in Cell Biology and Developmental Biology, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  types (7, 10) complicates the interpretation of these data. In addition, the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-P can be abolished by inactivation of pRB without affecting the ability of TGF-P to induce an increased gene expression, suggesting that pRB is not involved in a defined set of responses (1 1). So far, it has remained unknown whether these different activities of TGF-1 are mediated through a single receptor complex with divergent signaling pathways or by separate receptor-associated pathways. To determine the specific roles of the type II and type I receptors, one could overexpress the type II receptors or abolish the function of the type II receptors and then evaluate the resulting changes in the spectrum of biological activities of TGF-p. Our first approach was to overexpress the type II receptor in transfected cell lines. Because very few cell lines lack endogenous TGF-P receptors (1, 9, 12), and other components of the TGF-P receptor signaling pathways could possibly be defective in these cells, we overexpressed type II receptors in cells that contain a low level of TGF-P receptors and are sensitive to TGF,, such as the MvlLu cells (5). However, transient transfection assays with expression vectors for the human type II receptor (8) in QT6 and 293 cells resulted not only in increased cell surface expression of type II receptors but also in increased availability of type I receptors (Fig. 1A). This increase of type I receptors may be the result of the suggested interaction between both TGF-P receptor types (6, 7, 10).

							<Abstract>Two promoter elements are important for basal-level transcription, the TATA motif typically located 30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site and the initiator (Inr) element encompassing the start site. The mechanism of how Inr elements work is poorly understood, partly because very few proteins that bind to Inr elements have been identified and isolated. The recently cloned YY1 is such an Inr-binding protein. YY1 is able to direct transcription upon binding to its recognition sequence in vitro. The ability of YY1 to initiate transcription is augmented by the presence of a TATA motif or binding sites for transcription factor Sp1. To study the mechanism underlying the apparent functional cooperation between YY1 and Sp1, we explored the possibility of protein-protein interactions between these two transcription factors. We found that YY1 and Sp1 can form a physical complex. In addition, we identified domains within YY1 and Sp1 that mediate their interactions with each other. The physical interaction between YY1 and Sp1 may thus form the basis for the functional interplay observed previously.</Abstract>

							<Abstract>IL-11 is a novel cytokine with a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein which is distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteins between IL-11 and IL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gp130 antibodies which blocked IL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gp130 antibodies abolished cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, anti-IL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different ligand binding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gp130, in TF-1 cells.</Abstract>

IL-11 is a novel cytokine with  a variety of biofunctions which overlap with those of IL-6. We have previously identified IL-11 specific binding protein whichis distinct from that of IL-6 in a number of cell lines. The similarities in biofunctions and differences in ligand binding proteinsbetween IL-11 andIL-6 prompted us to investigate whether IL-11 shares common signal transduction mechanisms with IL-6. We have examined early signals triggered by IL-11 or IL-6 in a multifactor-dependent human erythroleukemic cell line, TF-1. The results showed that IL-11 and IL-6 can both stimulate cell proliferation, induce similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate the same proto-oncogene (junB) expression in TF-1 cells. These findings imply that IL-11 and IL-6 share similar early signaling events with the possibility of using the same signal transducer, gp130. We next tested whether IL-11 induced signaling can be inhibited by anti-gpl30 antibodies which blockedIL-6-mediated functions. It was observed that anti-gpl30 antibodies abolishedcell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and junB gene expression elicited by IL-11 or IL-6 in TF-1 cells. The same antibodies, however, had no effect on granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or erythropoietin-induced TF-1 cell proliferation. Finally, antiIL-6R antibody inhibited the ability of IL-6, but not IL-11, to transduce early signals in TF-1 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-11 and IL-6utilize different ligandbinding proteins, but share common signal transducer, gpl30, in TF-1 cells. lournal of Immunology, 1993, 151 : 2555.

'  IL-3-dependent megakaryocyte colony formation in both human and mouse bone marrow cultures (1,3).Our recent study demonstrated that IL-11 strongly augments Agspecific antibodyresponses both in vitro and in vivo in normal mice (4). In immunosuppresed mice, IL-11 significantly accelerates the regeneration ofAg-specific antibody forming cells in vivo (4). Similar to IL-6, 1L-11 can also induce production of acute phase proteins in rat hepatoma cells and in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes (5). Recently, it was found that IL-11 can inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity and preadipocyte differentiation (6, 7). These results suggest that IL-11 isa multifunctional cytokine which may play a prominent role in immunohematopoiesis. The overlapping biologic activities of IL-6 and IL-11 prompted the investigation that IL-11 may share the same Abbreviations used in thls paper: CM-CSF: granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating iactor; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor.

The IL-6R system consists of two components: a ligand binding subunit, p80 (8) and a transducersubunit, gpl30 (9). IL-6 binding to p80 promotes the association with the non-ligand binding subunit gp130 and the subsequent intracellular signaling events (IO, 11). Our initial biochemical studies have identified a 151-kDa protein distinct from p80 as the potential IL-I l binding protein (7). However, these resultsdid not rule out the possibility that IL- 11 and IL-6 may utilize similar or the same signal transducer proteins. To address this issue, antibodies against either the ligand binding (PMl) or the transducer subunit (anti-gpl30) of the human IL-6R complex were utilized to examine their effectson the stimulation of cell proliferation, the induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and the expressionof immediateresponse genes elicited by IL-6 or IL- I I in TF- 1 cells.

To examine this possibility, anti-gp130 antibodies which canblockIL-6mediated functions were first tested their abilityto inhibit in the proliferative effects of various cytokines on TF- 1 cells. As shown in Figure IA, anti-gp130 antibodies inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the proliferation of TF-1 cells stimulated by saturated concentrations of IL-6 orIL- 1 1. No inhibition of the TF-1 cell proliferation induced by GMCSF orerythropoietin was observed in the presence of antigp130 antibodies. We also tested the effect of anti-IL-6R antibody (PM 1) in the same system and found that PM1 significantly reduced IL-6 stimulated cell proliferation but had no effect on the mitogenic activitiesof IL- I 1, GM-CSF,  TF- 1 cells were washed three times with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubatedfor 14 to 16 h at 37"C, 5%CO1 in serum-free medium without any growth factors.

Anti-rIFN receptor antibodies were used as control antibodiesin cell proliferation assay and in the following experiments suchas protein tyrosinephosphorylationand junB gene expression, since TF-1cellsexpressfunctionalrIFN receptors (13). As shown in Figure 1B, anti-rIFN receptor antibodies did not inhibit TF-1cell proliferation stimulated with IL-11 or IL-6. These results not only supported our previousobservation that IL-11 and IL-6 utilize different cell surface receptors but also demonstrated that IL-11 and IL-6 share a common signal transducer, gp130. Effect of anti-gpl30 and PM1 antibodies on the 1L-11 and IL-6 induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in TF-1 cells  It has been well documented that protein tyrosine kinases may play important roles in growth factor mediated signal transduction in different systems (19, 20). We have previouslyshown that transmembranesignaling triggered by IL-11 isclosely linked to a tyrosine kinase pathway (7). To understand the role of tyrosine kinases in IL-11-mediated proliferative effects, we tested whether IL-11 and IL-6 can induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation in TF-1 cells. As shown in Figure 2, the 97/9S-kDa protein was the only band which reproducibly showed increase in tyrosine phosphorylation after IL-11 or IL-6 stimulationin over ten separate immunoblotting experiments. The kinetic study indicated that tyrosine phosphorylation induced by IL-11 peaked by 1 min, which was earlier than that of IL-6 (peaked by 15 min).Interestingly, both 97- and 95-kDa tyrosinephos phorylated  proteins appearedat 1min afterIL-6 stimulation and the intensity of 95-kDa band was stronger when compared with that of 97-kDa protein. The 95-kDa band disappeared by 15 min, while the intensity of the 97-kDa protein phosphorylation was greatly increased (Fig. %). In contrast to IL-6 stimulation, the intensity of 97-kDa phosphorylated protein was stronger than that of 95-kDa protein at 1min after IL-11 induction (Fig. 2 B ) . It is speculated that the 97 and 95-kDa tyrosine phoshorylated proteins are the same molecule. The different mobility in SDS-PAGE may be due to the various degrees of tyrosine phosphorylation of these two molecules. Although IL-11 induced different patterns of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in various cell types, the 97195-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein was present in all the cell lines responsive to IL-6 or IL-11. These results suggested that the 97/95-kDa protein may play important roles in IL-6or IL-11-mediated signal transduction. Recent studies have shown that gp130 can be tyrosine phosphorylated after stimulation of cells with IL-6 (ll), ciliary neurotrophic factor and LIF (21). It has been also demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 is essential for transducing signalsmediated by IL-6 (11). The failure to detect tyrosine phosphorylation corresponding to gp130 in Figure 2 may be in part due to the low level of gp130expression in TF-1 cells. To determine whether gp130 istyrosine phosphorylated by IL-11 stimulation,immunoprecipitation with anti-gpl30 antibody was performed and the immunoprecipitated gp130 moleculeswere analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting.

These results demonstrated that gp130 is indeedinvolved in theIL-11-mediatedsignal transduction. We also examined the effect of anti-gp130 antibodies on theinduction of tyrosine phosphorylation by these two growth factors. The results indicated that pretreatment of cells with anti-gpl30 antibodies (Fig. 2), but not with control antibodies (anti-human rIFNreceptor antibodies) as indicated in Figure 2C, blocked IL-11 and IL-6 induced the 97/95-kDa protein tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting tyrosine that gp130 is essential for IL-11- and IL-6-induced phosphorylation in TF-1 cells. Anti-1L-6 receptor antibody (PMl) significantly diminished the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by IL-6 (Fig. 2 4 ) , but had no effect on the IL-11-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2B).

Subsequent studies have indicated that the pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by IL-6 or IL- 11 vanes among different cell types (T. Yin et al. unpublished observations). It should be pointed out that recent publications (22, 23) indicated that a 160-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated protein was induced after stimulation with IL-6 or LIF in B cell hybridoma cells (22) and myeloid leukemia cells (23). In our experiments, we have consistently observed tyrosine phosphorylation of the 971 95-kDa protein after IL- 1 1 or IL-6 stimulation in a number of cell lines. The discrepancy between our results and those of others may be due to different types, cell antiphosphotyrosineantibodies or detection methods utilized in individual experiments. Nevertheless, it appears that there are cell type-specific tyrosine kinases activated by either IL-6 or IL-I 1. Further identification of these kinases and their respective substrates will be essential to uncover the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the signaling pathways mediated by IL-6 and IL- 11. Effects of anti-gpl30 and PM1 antibodies on junB gene expression induced by IL-6or IL-11 in TF-1 cells  Several studies (22,23) have shown that IL-6 can stimulate the expression of twoearly response genes, junB and tis1 1. To understand whether IL- and IL-6 can activate the same 11 early response genes which may play critical roles in controlling cell growth and differentiation (24, 25), we examined the expression of tisl, tis7, tis8, tisl0, tis1 1, tis21, junB, c-fos, c-myc, Fra-I, and NGFI-B in TF-1 cells. Among the eleven early response genes tested, only junB gene was activated by IL-I 1 or IL-6 in TF-I cells (Fig. 4). The kinetics of junB gene expression induced by IL-I 1 peaked earlier than that of IL-6 (30 min vs 60 min). After normalization with actin internal control, IL-l I and IL-6 stimulated at maximum 4.6-fold and 8.8-fold induction of  junB mRNA, respectively. Both anti-gpI30 andPM 1 antibodies inhibited the ability of IL-6 to induce the expression of junB in TF-1 cells (Fig. 4). The ability of IL-I 1 to stimulate junB expression in TF-I cells was only affected by anti-gp130 but notby PM 1. Anti-human rIFN antibodies had no effects on junB gene expression induced by IL-1 I or IL-6 (Fig. 4. righr). The product of junB gene is one of the junB/AP-1 family of nuclear proto-oncogene proteins which function in the transcriptional control of many eucaryotic genes (26,27). The finding that IL-1 I and IL-6 can activate the same early response gene indicates that these two factors use the same signal transduction pathway.The role of junB gene expression in IL- 11 and IL-6-mediated proliferative signals in TF-I cells requires further investigation. Previous studies have shown that cytokines such as IL-6 and LIF can utilize common signal transduction pathways as indicated by thecommonpattern of proteintyrosine phosphorylation and the expression of the same early response genes responding to IL-6 or LIF (22,23). Although we have observed different patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by IL-6 or IL-I 1 in different cell lines, in most cases, early response genes such as junB and tis I 1 are induced after IL-6 or IL-I 1 stimulation (T. Yin et al., unpublished observations). These results therefore suggest that there are convergent and divergent points the signal in transduction pathways for these cytokines. These observations may in part explain the common and unique biologic activities possessed by individual cytokines. In summary, Our studies demonstratethat both IL- I and 1 IL-6 can stimulate TF- 1 cell proliferation, induce the same pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation,and activate the expression of the same early response gene. We have further shown that anti-gp130 antibodies inhibited not only IL-6 but also IL-I I inducedcell proliferation, tyrosine phosphorylationandearlyresponse gene expression in TF-1 cells, confirming that IL-I 1 and IL-6 do share the  Downloaded from www.jimmunol.org on November 6, 2009  2560  g p l 3 0 TRANSDUCES IL-11 SIGNALS  same signal transducer, gp130.

Smearing of the major band suggests that there was some degree of proteolytic degradation. This preparation (1 mg/ml) was stored at -80°C in 50 mM tris-CI (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mM NaCI, 100 mM imidazole, 10 mM P-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol (15). The concentration of protein required to enhance HH16 activity increased slowly with storage, which suggests that there was a loss of activity with time. Thus, the reported concentrations may overestimate the amount of fully active NC required for stimulation. 9. C. Meric and S. P. Goff, J. Virol. 63, 1558 (1989); S. Oertle and P.-F.

The cleavage step proceeds at the same rate in the presence and in the absence of the NC (Fig. 3B). 17. This NC protein was prepared from an E. coli overproducer in the laboratory of L. Henderson (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). This 55-amino acid residue protein lacks 16 COOHterminal residues as well as the NH2-terminal (His)e tag present in our preparation (8) and is thought to correspond to the form found in the HIV virion [L. E. Henderson et al., J. Virol. 66, 1856 (1992)]. This preparation contained Zn2+ bound to the zinc fingers, whereas it was not known if Zn2+ was bound to the NC of the other preparation (8). Previous results have shown that binding and annealing activities occur in the absence of Zn2+, with mutations in the zinc fingers and with a variety of shortened versions of the protein (14) [H. DeRocquigny et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 21, 823 (1993)]. Stimulation of both single turnover and multiple turnover reactions of HH16 was observed whether the 55-amino acid protein was incubated before reaction with EDTA, which is expected to remove the bound Zn2+ (12). 18.

Before reaction, HH16 and S* were mixed and heated to 95°C for 2 min in the presence of 50 mM tris (pH 7.5) and 1 mM EDTA and cooled at room temperature to promote renaturation and annealing. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCI2 directly after the addition of the NC. The order of addition had no effect. 30. All results were quantitated with a Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). Rate constants were obtained for all reactions, from the initial rate formation of the 5' end-labeled product (P*) (after the burst) in multiple turnover reactions and from the first-order disappearance of S* in single turnover reactions. 31. Before reaction, HH16 and S* were separately heated to 95°C for 2 min in the presence of 50 mM tris (pH 7.5) and 1 mM EDTA and cooled at room temperature. After cooling, MgCI2 was added to HH16 and S* and we initiated the reaction by mixing together HH16 and S*. The NC or buffer was added 15 s after initiation. The order of addition had no effect. 32. The reactions whose results are shown in Fig. 4 were followed with a "kinetic ladder" (7). An alkaline ladder was generated with 5' end-labeled S or S'. After this mixture was neutralized, reactions of all of the substrates in the ladder were followed simultaneously. It was important to maintain ribozyme in large excess of the RNA substrates so that the presence of one substrate did not affect the reaction of another substrate-for example, by competing for a limited number of binding sites. The rate constants obtained for several oligonucleotides were compared to those obtained in standard assays with the single purified oligonucleotide; these values were the same, which demonstrates the validity of this approach (7). Because we did not have a strong prediction for the length of oligonucleotide substrate that would be required to obtain NC-enhanced specificity and we wished to gather the most information about these reactions, we used the kinetic ladder approach to investigate the effect of the NC on specificity. Data for only S,3rer and S'13mer are presented herein. 33. We thank K. Hertel, L. Henderson, and B. Pontius for generous gifts of materials, S. Muthani and M.

The 17S but not the 12S form of U2 snRNP is active in splicing-complex formation. Here it is shown that the SF3a subunits correspond to three of the 17SU2 snRNP-specific polypeptides.

As for U2 snRNP, which interacts with the pre-mRNA to form the presplicing complex (4), it exists in two forms, 12S or 17S (5, 6). The 12S U2 snRNP contains the common snRNP proteins and the U2 snRNP-specific proteins A' and B" (7). The 17S U2 snRNP contains an additional set of polypeptides of 35, 53, 60, 66, 92, 110, 120, 150, and 160 kD (6).

(Fig. 2B). The concomitant decrease in the sedimentation rate of U2 snRNP and SF3a suggests that SF3a dissociates from the U2 particle in the presence of a high salt concentration. The similarity in the sedimentation behavior of the 17S U2 snRNPspecific polypeptides (6) and SF3a in response to increased salt concentrations is further evidence that this splicing factor is associated with U2 snRNP in nuclear extracts. In agreement with these data, U2 snRNA is the predominant RNA that is precipitated from nuclear extracts with mAb66 (II). A reproducible heterogeneity in the snRNP populations has been observed after Mono Q chromatography (15). When analyzed by Western blotting with mAb66 or  SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 1C) reveals that, in addition to the comigration of the 60- and 66-kD polypeptides, SF3a'20 comigrates with the 110-kD polypeptide of the 17S U2 snRNP. These results suggest that SF3a is part of the 17S U2 particle. The 17S U2 snRNP-specific polypeptides dissociate from the particle at salt concentrations of 200 mM or higher (6). When nuclear extracts are fractionated in glycerol gradients at 150 mM KCI (14), SF3a (as detected with mAb66 and antiPRP9) cosediments with U2 snRNP in the 17S region of the gradient (Fig. 2A). Some SF3a is found in the top fractions of the gradient, consistent with a sedimentation coefficient of 5.5S for purified SF3a (3).

The 60-kD polypeptide of the 17S U2 snRNP cross-reacts with an antibody to yeast PRP9 (anti-PRP9) (8); PRP9 functions in the assembly of the yeast presplicing complex (9). The presence of 60-, 66-, and 120-kD polypeptides in both SF3a and the 17S U2 snRNP along with the functioning of SF3a, 17S U2 snRNP, and PRP9 at the same stage of spliceosome assembly suggested that these factors may share structural features. In Western blotting experiments (10) the anti-PRP9 specifically recognizes purified SF3a60, and a single polypeptide of similar size was detected in a HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 1A). No reaction with mammalian proteins was observed with preimmune serum (11). Anti-PRP9 also recognizes the 60-kD 17S U2-specific protein (Fig. 1B) (12). In the particular gel system used, staining of a doublet is sometimes observed (13). Moreover, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against SF3a66 (mAb66) (3) cross-reacts with the 17S U2 snRNP polypeptide of 66 kD. The direct comparison of SF3a and 17S U2 snRNP proteins by  anti-PRP9, SF3a was detected (as expected) in Mono Q fractions (eluting between 200 and 280 mM KCI) that exhibited activity in presplicing-complex formation (11). Lower concentrations of SF3a were found in fractions enriched in U1 snRNP (350 mM KC1) which also contained the 17S U2 particle. Fractions highly enriched  devoid of SF3a. Mono Q chromatography can separate specific proteins from snRNPs (16), and it is likely that SF3a dissociates from U2 snRNP as a result of the salt conditions used during chromatographic fractionation. A similar observation has been made in the case of the [U4/U6.U5]  in the 12S U2 snRNP  ' A B C Fig. 1.

These proteins are functionally equivalent to a splicing activity (heat shock labile splicing factor) that is inactivated during the heat shock of HeLa cells. Heat shock also affects U2 snRNP by converting it to a particle of fast electrophoretic mobility (19). Thus, the integration of the spliceosomal snRNPs into splicing complexes could be regulated by the association-dissociation of snRNP-specific polypeptides and splicing factors depending on the state of the cell. Both constitutive and alternative splicing could be influenced by the availability of such protein factors in different tissues or at different developmental stages of an organism. We next tested whether purified SF3a  label allowed us to detect the RNA after native PAGE (20). A major and a minor form of U2 snRNP were detected in a nuclear extract in the upper third of the gel (Fig. 3) (21, 22). The 17S U2 snRNP  present in the Mono Q-U1 fraction, used as a control, migrated slightly faster than the major form detected in the nuclear extract, whereas the U2 snRNP of the Mono Q-U2 fraction was detected at the bottom of the gel. When this fraction was incubated with SF3a, no change in electrophoretic mobility was apparent, indicating that SF3a by itself does not stably bind to  active 17S U2 snRNP cannot account for the ATP requirement observed for presplicing-complex formation (24). Binding of Ul1 snRNP to the 5' splice site as well as binding of U2AF to the polypyrimidine tract located upstream of the 3' splice site occur in the absence of ATP (5, 25). Hence, the interactions of U1 snRNP and U2AF with the pre-mRNA and the assembly of the 17S U2 snRNP most likely precede the association of mammalian splicing factor SC35 with the prespliceosome, a reaction that is ATP-dependent The cross-reaction of anti-PRP9 with the 60-kD polypeptide of SF3a and the 17S U2 snRNP suggests that this polypeptide represents the human homolog of the yeast splicing protein PRP9. Both polypeptides also share significant homologies in their deduced amino acid sequences (27). An immunological relation to PRP9 has also been observed for SAP61 (28), a protein component of the mammalian presplicing complex (29). SAP61 corresponds to SF3a60, as shown by co-electrophoresis of these polypeptides in 2D gels (30), and SF3a66 and SF3a120 are identical to SAP62 and SAP114, respectively. The protein SAP62 appears to be the human homolog of the yeast splicing protein PRP11 (28). Thus, SF3a activity can be correlated with two yeast proteins that are both required for the assembly of the ATP-dependent pre n z  --+ATP----, i  r-ATP-  n-  I.  .

Given the structural relation between the mammalian and yeast splicing factors, it now becomes feasible to analyze whether this similarity extends to a conservation of their function during the splicing reaction. 1.

Fractions containing SF3a or SF3b or both were incubated with U2 snRNP followed by the addition of a radiolabeled oligoribonucleotide complementary to the 5' end of U2 RNA. This  U2 snRNP. However, when U2 snRNP was incubated with a fraction that contained SF3a and SF3b (Mono Q-SF3), two bands of low electrophoretic mobility appeared, suggesting that SF3b might be required for the SF3a-U2 snRNP interaction. When U2 snRNP was incubated with partially purified SF3b, U2 RNA comigrated with the lower complex formed in the presence of the Mono Q-SF3 fraction. Titration of SF3a into this reaction mixture converted the complex to a slower migrating form. The latter form of U2 snRNP comigrated with the major U2 complex detected in nuclear extract and with 17S U2 snRNP. The interactions of SF3b and SF3a with U2 snRNP appear to be specific for the U2 particle because no change in the electrophoretic mobility of U1 snRNP was observed in a similar experiment (11). Thus, a component or components present in the SF3b fraction prepare U2 snRNP for an interaction with SF3a, consistent with the finding that both splicing factors are required for presplicing-complex assembly (3). The finding that SF3b also participates in the formation of the 17S U2 snRNP suggests that this fraction contains some or all of the remaining 17S U2-specific proteins, although other possibilities cannot be ruled out. It should be possible to clarify this issue once SF3b is available in pure form. In any case, our results indicate that the assembly of the 17S U2 snRNP can be separated into at least two steps: the action of SF3b followed by the binding of SF3a. The association of SF3a and SF3b with the 12S U2 snRNP most likely corresponds to the previously described interaction of nuclear components with an in vitro-assembled U2 snRNP that results in the formation of a U2 particle of slow electrophoretic mobility (23). A difference between these two approaches, however, is the requirement for ATP to form the low (26).  .2.S.g.Ih.83.8.k. 7.  R. Luhrmann, B. Kastner, M. Bach, Biochim. Biophys.

Here, a generalizable strategy was used to isolate a complementary DNA encoding the mammalian spliceosome-associated protein (SAP) SAP 62. It is demonstrated that SAP 62 is the likely functional homolog of the yeast PRP11 protein. Both PRP11 and SAP 62 associate stably with the spliceosome, contain a single zinc finger, and display significant amino acid sequence similarity. Unlike PRP11, SAP 62 contains 22 proline-rich heptapeptide repeats at the carboxyl-terminus.  1439 (1991). 18. U. Utans, S. E. Behrens, R. Luhrmann, R. Kole, A. Kramer, ibid. 6, 631 (1992). 19. U.

Furthermore, a slowly migrating form of U2 snRNP was detected in nuclear extracts with the same oligoribonucleotide used here (22). Therefore, we anticipated that an interaction of proteins with U2 snRNP would not be disturbed by the oligoribonucleotide. Results identical to the ones shown were obtained by Northern (RNA) blotting of native gels and probing with radiolabeled antisense U2 RNA. M. M. Konarska and P. A.

In the predicted amino acid sequence of SAP 62 (Fig. 1A) one zinc  The mammalian spliceosomal protein SAP 62 first binds to pre-mRNA in the prespliceosomal complex A (1) and cross-links to the 3' portion of the pre-mRNA in this complex (2). A functional 3' splice site and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are required for this interaction, indicating that SAP 62 may play an important role at the 3' splice site (1). Originally SAP 62 was identified as one of more than 20 proteins that associate stably and in an ATP- and splice sitedependent manner with highly purified spliceosomes on two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis (1). We have increased the scale of our spliceosome purification procedure to obtain sufficient amounts of individual proteins from 2D gels for sequence analysis (3). On the basis of the peptide sequences, we have isolated a complementary DNA (cDNA) clone encoding SAP 62 as well as cDNAs encoding other spliceofinger of the C2H2 class (5) is present. The presence of this zinc finger leads us to predict that SAP 62 is a nucleic acid binding protein, consistent with the observation that SAP 62 can be cross-linked by ultraviDepartment of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In contrast with the essential splicing factors cloned so far in mammals, U2AF (6) and the serine-arginine-rich family (7), SAP 62 lacks a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) binding domain of the RNA recognition motif (RRM) type (8) and does not contain an arginine-serine (RS) domain.  The COOH-terminal third of SAP 62 is  (1987).  proline-rich (43%) and is organized into 22 tandem heptapeptide repeats of the sequence GVHPPAP (Fig. 1B). A similar number of heptapeptide repeats of the sequence YSPTSPS are present in the COOH-terminus of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), and phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in these repeats plays a critical role in RNAP II activity (9). A feature of the SAP 62 repeats is their proline richness, which suggests that the repeats may be involved in protein-protein interactions. Although proline richness is characteristic of several RNA and some DNA binding proteins (10, II), there is no precedent of conserved heptapeptide repeats in essential splicing factors or in other RNA binding proteins. We detected by Northern (RNA) blot analysis of HeLa cell mRNA with the SAP 62 cDNA as a probe an mRNA of about 2 kb (Fig. 2) (12).

									<Abstract>The spectrin tetramer, the principal structural element of the red cell membrane skeleton, is formed by stable head-to-head self-association of two spectrin heterodimers. The self-association site appears to be formed by interactions between helices 1 and 2 of beta spectrin repeat 17 of one dimer with helix 3 of alpha spectrin repeat 1 of the other dimer to form two combined alpha-beta triple-helical segments. The head of the heterodimer appears to involve similar intradimer interactions. We describe the first example of an amino acid substitution in helix 1 of this combined alpha-beta triple-helical segment, which, although relatively minor, profoundly impairs tetramer formation. Strikingly, low angle rotary shadowing electron microscopy of isolated spectrin dimers reveals that this mutation also severely disrupts the head of the heterodimer causing it to be open. Following linkage studies which were most consistent with a beta spectrin gene mutation, a nucleotide change was identified in codon 2018, resulting in an Ala--&gt;Gly substitution in the first helical domain of beta spectrin repeat 17. Because glycine is a strong helix breaker, this change is predicted to disrupt the conformation of this helical domain. Our results indicate that this helical domain must play direct roles in the alpha-beta interdimer interactions that form the self-association site of the tetramer and in the alpha-beta intradimer interactions at the head of the heterodimer.</Abstract>

									<Abstract>The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the RBP1 and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.</Abstract>

								<BodyText>The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, regulates cell proliferation by binding to and inhibiting the activity of key growth promoting proteins. Several cellular proteins have been shown to bind directly to pRB and the genes encoding a number of them have been isolated. The protein product of one of these genes is the transcription factor E2F. We have now isolated cDNA clones that contain the full-length coding sequence of two other proteins, RBP1 and RBP2, cloned originally by their interaction with pRB. The products of the RBP1 and RBP2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, large (200 kDa for RBP1 and 195 kDa for RBP2) nuclear phosphoproteins with structural motifs that suggest a role in transcriptional regulation. In addition we have been able to identify complexes of pRB and RBP1 in vivo that are dissociated in the presence of purified human papillomavirus E7 protein.</BodyText>

									<Abstract>Although both unstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferate to IL-7. This responsiveness may occur as a direct result of changes in the structure of the IL-7R during T-cell activation. We have previously demonstrated such changes by affinity cross-linking studies, and have shown that unstimulated human T cells express a single IL-7R of 90 kDa, whereas activated T cells express an additional 76-kDa IL-7 binding protein. In this study the origin and function of the p90 and p76 molecules have been investigated. To determine the role of each of these receptors in IL-7 driven proliferation, IL-7R expression and proliferative capacity were monitored during mitogenic stimulation. These analyses showed that the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlated with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. IL-7-driven proliferation is mediated via high affinity IL-7R, and accordingly, Scatchard analysis revealed that, like the p90 IL-7R, the p76 IL-7R bound IL-7 with dual (high; Kd 38 pM and low; Kd 360 pM) affinity. Deglycosylation studies showed that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are not simply differently glycosylated isoforms of a single receptor. In agreement, mAb to the previously cloned IL-7R were found to stain unstimulated T cells that express only the p90 IL-7R but not T-cell clones that express predominantly the p76 IL-7R. These antibodies also immunoprecipitated the cloned IL-7R as a 90-kDa species from both 125-I-surface-labeled resting and activated T cells, but were unable to precipitate the 76-kDa IL-7R. In addition, PCR analysis of p76-expressing cells could not detect splicing of the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R, thereby excluding the possibility that the p76 IL-7R is a previously undescribed splice variant of the cloned IL-7R. These data demonstrate that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the cloned IL-7R, and imply that the p90 and p76 IL-7R have different extracellular domains.

Although bothunstimulated and activated human T cells express high affinity IL-7R, only activated T cells can proliferateto IL-7.

Journal of Immunology, 1993, 151 : 4753.  L-7 was originally described as a pre-B cell growth factor (l),but has more recently been shown to act upon other cell types within the immune system, including both mature and immature T cells (2-4). IL-7 mediates its activities by binding to specific cell surface receptors, and ligand binding studies have demonstrated the presenceof high (&amp; 100 pM) (5), low (&amp; 1 nM) (5, 6), and more recently, ultra low (&amp; 10 pM) affinity receptors (7) on the surface of human T cells.

This article must therefore be hereby marked advertisement in accordance with 18 U.S.C. Section 1734 solely to indicate this fact.  though the roles of the low and ultra low affinity receptors are unknown, the biologic activities of IL-7 are mediated via high affinity receptor binding. Both the high and the low affinity IL-7 binding sites can be generated by expression of a single,recently cloned, dualaffinity IL-7R (8). In contrast, the ultra low affinity receptor is a distinct entity (7). Alternativesplicing of the human geneencodingthe cloned IL-7R can generate three mRNA species, encoding a soluble receptor and two membrane-bound forms: one full length, the other with altered, truncated cytoplasmic doan main (8). However, although both membrane-bound forms of this receptor can bind IL-7 with high (and low) affinity,  ' This work was supported by the Medical Research Council, National Kidney Research Fund, and the Wellcome Trust.

Thus, in common with many other membersof the cytokine receptor family, the expression of these receptors in isolation may be insufficient to mediate IL-7driven responses. This postulate is reinforced by the observation that although high affinity IL-7R are expressed on both resting and activated human T cells (5),the response of these cells to IL-7 varies with their activation state: IL-7 is a potent growth factor for activated T cells (2, 5 , 9-10), whereas resting T cells respond only by expressing activation Ag such as CD25 and the 4F2 Ag (10, 11). These data imply that IL-7-driven T-cell proliferation may require the expression of additional molecules that are absent from resting cells. In agreement with this hypothesis we have previously shown that during T-cell activation the IL-7R undergoes distinct structural changes. Unstimulated T cells were shown to express a singleIL-7R of 90 kDa (seen as a 107kDa IL-7 cross-linked complex), whereas activated T cells expressed reduced levels of this p90 IL-7R, and an additional IL-7 binding molecule of 76 kDa (seen as an IL-7 cross-linked complex of 93 kDa) (5). This p76 receptor is also expressed on IL-7-responsive T-cell clones, and we have postulated that this molecule may be necessary for IL-7-driven proliferation in human T cells. Preliminary evidence to suggest that the p90 and p76 receptors have distinct origins came from the observation that their IL-7 cross-linked complexes behave differently after the reduction of intrachain disulfide bonds. The apparent molecular weight of the p90 protein (107-kDa complex) decreases, whereas that of the p76 protein (93-kDa complex)increases (5); suggesting that there are differences in the cysteine content of the p90 and p76 IL-7R proteins. In addition, recent studies have shown that PBMC activated in the presence of the immunosuppressive drugs CyA or FK506 continue to express the p90 receptor at preactivation levels, but fail to express the p76 receptor (12). These data suggest that transcriptional control of the p90 and p76 molecules differs. Taken together these data imply that these proteins may be the products of separate genes. At present, however, the origin the p90 and p76 IL-7R, of and their relationship to both the ultra-low affinity IL-7R (67 kDa), and to the two membrane-bound forms of the cloned human IL-7R (whose molecular weights have not been established) (8), is unknown. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the origin of the p90 and p76 IL-7R. We show that the p90 IL-7R is the T-cell homologue of the previously cloned IL-7R. These results therefore provide the first demonstration of the molecular weight of the cloned human IL-7R in vivo. In contrast, the p76 IL-7R is immunologically distinct from the cloned IL-7R. This novel activation Ag is associated with the expression of dual (high and low) affinity  IL-7 binding sites on the surface of human T cells, indicating that it is also distinct from the ultra-low affinity IL7R. In addition, we provide further evidenceto suggest that the p76 IL-7R may be intimately associated with IL-7driven proliferation in human T lymphocytes.  Materials and Methods Reagents  Recombinant hIL-2 a was generous gift from Dr. P. Lomedico(RocheInc., NJ, USA). Recombinant human IL-7 and polyclonal rabbit anti-hIL-7 antibodies were generous gifts from Dr. C. Faltynek and Ms. Marian Kelley (Sterling Winthrop Pharmaceuticals, Malvern, PA, USA.). Iodination of IL-7 was performed as previously described (13). mAb were generous gifts fromthe Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford, UK. (OX26), Drs. S. Gillis and L. Park (Immunex Corp) (M27, anti IL-7R, IgGl), or were purchased from Genzyme Corp. (mouse anti hIL-7R, No. 1747-01, (IgG2b).)  Cells and culture conditions PBMC were prepared using Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Norway) from citrated human blood obtained from leukophoresis residues (South London Blood Transfusion Centre, London, UK). PBMC wereactivated by culturing in the presence of 10 ng/ml anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3). The JMaP T-cell clone was a generous gift from Dr. M. Londei (14). JMaP cellswere maintained by stimulation every two weeks with either irradiated feeders, PHA (Difco) and 20 ng/ml rhIL-2, or with immobilized OKT3 and 20 ng/ml IL-2. All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO Uxbridge, UK)containing10%FCS (Biological Industries Cumbernauld, UK), 2 mM glutamine, 100 Fg/ml streptomycin, 100 U/ml penicillin. Affinity cross-linking  5 X lo6 cells were incubated with 5 nM rh '25-I-IL-7 for 1 h on ice. Cross-linking was performed in the presence of disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (Pierce, Rockford, IL) as previously described (13). Cross-linked cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% w/v acrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions,thereby allowing resolution of the p76 and p90 receptors (5). The cross-linking profiles presented herein are presumed to relate only to T-cell IL-7R expression for a number of reasons. Firstly, CD3+ cells represent 70 to 80% of the PBMC population regardless of activation state. Secondly, mature B cells (10 to 12%) do not express IL-7R (6), and although cells of the monocytebnacrophagelineage are known to respond to IL-7 (15,16), we been unable to cross-link them under have these conditions (not shown).  Journal of Immunology Proliferation assays immunoprecipitation  4755  Cells were incubated at 1 X lo5 cells/well in RPMI media in a total volume of 200 p l in round bottom 96-well plates (Nunc). rhIL-7 was added to each well at the concentrations indicated. Culture was for 24 h at 37"C/5% CO2. 0.5 pCi [3H]thymidine (Amersham, Amersham, UK) was added for the final 6 h of culture. '251-lL-7 ligand binding and Scatchard analysis  Ligand binding and Scatchard analyses were performed as previously described (13). Deglycosylation studies  Activated PBMC (72 were cross-linkedto 125-I-IL-7and h) electrophoresed through 7.5% w/v polyacrylamide gel as described above. After transfer to PVDF membranes (Millipore) 1251-IL-7cross-linked complexes were located by autoradiography of the dried membrane. Strips memof brane containing I z 5 I labeled complexes were excised and treated with de-glycosylating/sialylating enzymes as follows. Membrane strips werecovered with a minimum volume of 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 7.0 (PNGase or O-glycanase) or with PBS (neuraminidase) containing1% NP40 and 1 mM PMSF, and incubated with either 0.5 U/ml neuraminidase (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA)at 37°Cfor 1 h, 10 U/ml PNGase (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) at room temperature for 14 to 17 h or, after neuraminidase treatment, 10 U/ml 0-Glycanase (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) at room temperature for14 to 17 As a control, membrane h. strips containing cross-linked complex were incubated under identical conditions without enzyme. After treatment, membrane strips were boiled in Gel Sample buffer (GSB; 125 mM Tris. HCl pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% w/v SDS, 0.0025% bromophenol blue) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% w/v acrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions. Flow cytometry 0.5 X lo6 cells as a single cell suspension were incubated with 50 pl of M27 antibody (10 pg/ml) in a total volume of 100 pl for 1h on ice. After washing, cells were incubated with 50 pl of a 1/100 dilution of either FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (single color staining) PE-conjugated or goatanti-mouse Ig (Southern BiotechnologyAssociates Inc. Birmingham, AL) (dual color staining) for 1 h on ice. Cells to be stained with two colors were incubated with then a 1/100dilution of normal mouse serum, washed again, and finally incubated with 5 pl anti-human CD3-FITC (Becton Dickinson) for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed,and fixed in 3% formaldehyde before analysis on a Beckton Dickinson FACSStar Plus flow cytometer.  Viable cells in 100 p PBS were radiolabeled by the ad1 dition of 10 p l ( 1 mCi) lz5I (Amersham), 30 plglucose (18 mg/ml), 30 p l glucose oxidase (21 U/ml), and 30 p l lactoperoxidase (0.2 mg/ml). After 15 min at room temperature, cells were washed, then lysed in 1% NP40,lO mM Tris pH 8.0,150mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% BSA, and 1 mM PMSF. Insolubledebriswas removed by centrifugation, and supernatants were precleared twice with 20 p g of an irrelevant antibody and Protein G Sepharose (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Supernatants werethen incubated for 1 h on ice with 50 p g of anti-IL-7R mAb (M27 or 1747-01) or 20 p g of anti-IL-7 polyclonal antibody (for precipitation of cross-linked complexes), followed by the addition of Protein G Sepharose for 12 to 16 h.

Pellets were boiled in GSB and electrophoresed through 7.5% w/v acrylamide gel.  cDNA synthesis and polymerase chain reaction  To synthesize cDNA,1p g of total RNAwas incubated with 2 p g oligo dT (Pharmacia), 5 ng BSA, 0.5 mM dNTPs, 10 mM dithiothreitol,10 pl of 5X RT buffer (Y00146, GIBCO BRL) and 20 U reverse transcriptase (Moloney murine leukemia virus, GIBCO BRL) in a total volume of 50 p at 1 37°C for 1 h. PCR3 reactions were performed using 1 pl of this cDNA in the presence of KC1 (0.1 M), Tris pH 8.3 (20 mM), MgC12 (1.5 mM), gelatin (0.02%), dNTPs (0.4 mM), 1 p M of each primer, and 2.5 U Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus) in a total volume of 20 pl. Samples were overlaid with 10 pl of light mineral oil (Sigma Chemical Co.) and were incubated at 93°C for 1 min, 56°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 1 min. This cycle wasrepeated 30 times using a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Beaconsfield, UK). Primers for the IL-7R have the sequence S`TGGAGACTTGGAAGATGCA3' (bp 103-121 of cDNAH20 (8)) and 5'TTAGTAAGATAGGATCCAT3' (bp 734-752 of cDNAH20 (8)). Primers forhuman p-actin have the sequence S'CAGAACCCTGACCCTGCCGTGTAC3' and S'GTGTCCACAGTTTAGGTTCGTATCTGT3'. For Southern analysis, 10 pl of each PCR reaction was electrophoresed through a 2% w/v agarose gel. After transfer to nylon membrane (Hybond N; Amersham), PCR products were visualized by probing with a y-[32P]ATP end-labeled oligonucleotide, with the sequence 5`TACCGCCAGGAAAAGGATGA3' (bp 527-546 of cDNA H20 (8)).

Thus, the ability of PBMC to proliferate to IL-7 correlates with expression of the p76 IL-7R, and not with expression of the p90 IL-7R. The proliferation of PBMC in the absence of exogenously added IL-7 is thought to be a consequence of the production of other growth factors such as IL-2 and IL-4. Studies using an IL-7-specific ELISA sensitive to 1 pM IL-7 have failed to detect endogenously produced IL-7 in culture supernatants from these cells, suggesting that IL-7 is notpresent in significant quantities in these cultures (not shown).

Position of the 93-kDa and 107kDa complexes are indicated.

Results Kinetics of p90 and p76 IL-7R expression and IL-7-driven proliferation  To establish the relationship between p90 and p76 IL-7R expression andIL-7-driven proliferation, human PBMC were stimulated in culture with anti-CD3 antibody, and the cross-linking profile and proliferative capacity of the cells were monitored. Figure 1 shows that although the p90 IL-7R (107-kDa cross-linked complex) is present in both resting and activated PBMC, the p76 IL-7R (93-kDa complex) is not detected until 24 h after the addition of mitogen. Expression of this complex peaks at 48 h, and declines thereafter. As reported previously (5), p90 IL-7R expression also diminishes after 72 to 96 h, although moreso than thep76 IL-7R7 Deglycosylation of p90 and p76 IL-7 receptors such that at 72 h and beyond, the p76 IL-7R is the Inasmuch as the p90 and p76 IL-7 receptors bind IL-7 with predominant species seen. identical affinities, we examined whether these molecules The higher m.w. complex (approximately 180 kDa) prewere simplydifferentlyglycosylated forms of a single sent at all timepoints is thought to represent a multimer of receptor. the p90 and/or p76 IL-7R (5, 8).

Treatment of the 107-kDa complex (p90 IL-7R) with In agreement with previous data (5) the corresponding proliferation assays show that unstimulated PBMC, which PNGase resulted in a decrease in molecular mass of approximately 16 kDa, such that this complex migrated with express only the p90 IL-7R, do not proliferate to IL-7. In an apparent molecular weight of 91 kDa (Fig. 4). Similar contrast, activated cells proliferate well to IL-7 (Fig. 2).  Radioligand binding studies and Scatchard analyses have previously demonstrated that both resting (t = 0) and activated (t = 72 h) human PBMCR cells express high and low affinity IL-7 receptors with identical affinities (&amp; 34 pM ( 210 pM) and Kd 685 pM ( 5 125 pM) respectively) (5). Although these data demonstrate that sole expression of the p90 IL7R on resting cells correlates with the expression of dual affinity receptors (Fig. 3A), the contribution of the newly expressed IL-7R to ligand bindingin p76 activated cells has not been established. The IL-7-responsive T-cell clone JMaP expresses almost exclusively the p76 IL-7R (5), (p90 IL-7R expression can be detectedon these cells only after prolonged exposure of autoradiographs). '=I-IL-7 ligand binding and Scatchard analysis (n = 3) showed that JMaP cells express approximately 400 (573) high (&amp; 38 pM 5 17 pM) and 1200 (2400) low (&amp; 360 pM 2 75 pM) affinity IL-7R (Fig. 3B). Thus, the p76 IL-7R expressed on these cells appears to bind IL-7 with affinities (both high and low) comparable to those of the p90 IL-7R on resting PBMC. This finding is consistent with the observation that expression of the p76 IL-7R after T-cell activation does not resultin an alteration in IL-7R affinities (5).  +  Journal of Immunology  4757  80000  T  0 Y  : K 0 0  60000  FIGURE 2.

In contrast, treatment of the 93-kDa cross-linked complex (p76 IL-7R) withPNGase reduced its molecular weight by approximately 15 kDa, to 78 kDa (Fig. 4). Treatment of the 107kDa complex with neuraminidase and 0-glycanase to remove 0-linked sugars did not produce a change apparent in m.w. However, removal of 0-linked sugars from the 93kDa cross-linked complex reduced its molecular weight by approximately 5 kDa to 88 kDa. Since the removal of N and 0-linked sugars from the p90 and p76 IL-7R fails to reveal a protein of common molecular weight, it is thought unlikely that these two species are the results variable glycosylationof a singlereceptor of form. Cell staining and immunoprecipitation studies with antibodies to the cloned IL-7R  Alternative splicing is known to generate mRNA encoding two distinct membrane-bound ('full length' and 'truncated') formsof the cloned human IL-7R (8). Both of these receptorshaveidenticalextracellulardomains (8), and would be expected to bind IL-7 with identical affinities. Further, antibodies specific for this domain would be expected to recognize both forms of this receptor. Two mAb (M27 and 1747-01) that appear to recognize different epitopes on the extracellulardomain of the cloned  IL-7R (our own unpublished observations), were used to examine whether the p90 and p76 IL-7R were simply the `full length' and `truncated'forms of the cloned IL-7R respectively. Unstimulated PBMC, which express onlythe p90 IL-7R (107-kDa IL-7 cross-linked complex) showed significant cell surface staining with the M27 antibody (Fig. 5A). In contrast,stainingwasundetectable on the JMaP T-cell clone, which expresses the p76 IL-7R (visualized as the 93-kDa IL-7 cross-linked complex), and only extremely low levels of the p90 IL-7R (Fig.5B). To confirm that the M27 staining seen in PBMC is located within the T-cell population, resting PBMC were double stained with both M27 (PE) and anti-CD3 (FITC). Figure 5C shows that the majority of M27+ cells (&amp;gt;90%) are also CD3+, the small percentage of M27+/CD3- cells are thought to represent monocytic cells, which are known to stain weakly with M27 (our own unpublished observations).The1747-01 antibody is unable to stain cells for FACS analysis (not shown). The M27and 1747-01 antibodies were also used in immunoprecipitationstudies. Both antibodiesimmunoprecipitated a 90-kDa protein from `25-I-surface-labeled unstimulated PBMC (Fig. 6). A n additional minor species of 200 kDa was also precipitated by both antibodies (see Discussion).

As expected, the anti-IL-7 antibody precipitated both the 107-kDa and 93-kDa crosslinked complexes (Fig. 7A).Identical results were obtained using three anti-IL-7 mAb (not shown). In contrast, the anti-IL-7R antibody only immunoprecipitated the 107-kDa complex, confirming that the 90-kDa protein is an intrinsic part of the 107-kDa receptor-ligand complex, but is not involved in the formation of the 93-kDa complex (Fig. 7B). This conclusion is supported by experiments in which immunoprecipitates were first precleared with the 1747-01 antibody,andthen precipitated with the anti-IL-7polyclonal. The 107-kDa complex was selectively removed, whereas precipitation of the 93-kDa complex was unaffected (not shown). Clearly then, both the M27 and 1747-01 antibodies recognize only the p90 protein, demonstrating that this protein is the T-cell homolog of the cloned IL-7R. Moreover, neither antibody recognizes the p76 IL-7R, suggesting that the extracellular domain of this receptor is immunologically distinct from the cloned p90 IL-7R. Thus, the p76 IL-7R is  Journal of Immunology  4759  A) UNSTIMULATED PBMC KDa  IL-7R  t  200   250  1 (ii)  974  -  U  +I  07KDa  c93KDa  FLUORESCENCE  INTENSITY  69   IL-7R  8  ) J M ab KDa  CD3   200  -  974-  +I  07KDa  -93KDa  69  -  FIGURE  5.

PCR analysis of IL-7R mRNA in resting and activated PBMC  The observation that antibodies to the cloned IL-7R recognize the p90 IL-7R, but not the p76 IL-7R demonstrates that these two proteins have unique extracellular domains. As stated previously, the cloned IL-7R gene is known to undergo alternative splicing of the transmembrane/ cytoplasmic domain to generate multiple receptor forms (8). Using PCR analysis, we explored the possibility that alternative splicing of the extracellular domain of this receptor might also occur, thus generating forms of the receptor with altered extracellular domains. Oligonucleotide primers were positioned such that they would amplify across the extracellular domain of the cloned  IL-7R. Primers were positioned across exons 1 and 2 (forward primer), and within exon 6 (the transmembrane domain, reverse primer) (17). Such primers wouldbeexpected to produce a product of 640 bp from all previously described forms of the cloned IL-7R (Fig. 84). mRNA encoding receptors with deletions or insertions in their extracellular domain would be expected to yield smaller or larger PCR products respectively. Deletion of theexons to which these PCR primers hybridize would not be responsible for producing a mRNA encoding the p76 IL-7R. Deletion of the exon recognized by the reverse primer (the transmembrane domain) would produce a soluble receptor, whichwouldnotbe detected by surface cross-linking, whereas deletion of exons 1andlor 2 (site recognized by the forward primer) would firstly remove the promoter region (exon l), and would also result in a shift in the reading frame, and hence a nonsense protein (deletion of exon 2).  4760  CHARACTERIZATION OF A NOVEL HIGH  AFFINITY IL-7 RECEPTOR  JMaP  PBMC  KDa  KDa  B  200  107-0  97 4 93  -  107  -+  69 46-  FIGURE  6.

Moreover, in three out of four time courses examined, the amount of PCR product at 24 h has also been lower than that ofunstimulated PBMC, (as seen in Fig. 8B).These observations may reflectdifferences in the level of IL-7R mRNA. However,because of the low levels of IL-7Rmessage within these cells we have not been able to confirm this hypothesis by Northern analysis. As expected, PCR amplification across the transmembrane/cytoplasmic region of the cloned IL-7Rrevealed PCR products consistent with the full length (predominant species), truncated, and soluble forms of the cloned IL-7R. No changes in the relative expression of these transcripts between resting and activated PBMC were seen (not shown).  Amplification of cDNA from resting ( t = 0) and activated ( t = 24 to f = 120 h) PBMC, JMaP cells, and the WI26VA4 cell line (from which the IL-7R was originally cloned) revealed a single PCR product of 640 bp after probing with oligos specific for either exons 2 (not shown) or 4 (Fig. 8B). Digestion of these PCR products with the restriction enzyme Pst-1 (site within exon 5) produced fragments of identical sizes (not shown). Together these data demonstrate that exons 1 and 2 (recognized by 5' PCR primer, and oligo used as probe), exon 4 (oligo used as probe), exon 5 (Pst-1 site) and exon 6 (recognized by 3' PCR primer) are present within these PCR products. The presence of exons 2,3,4,5, and 6 has also been confirmed by sequence analysis (not shown). These data demonstrate that the cloned IL-7R does not undergo alternative splicing in this region. Thus, the p76 IL-7R is unlikely to be generated as the result of an alternative splicing event in the extracellular domain of the cloned IL-7R. The apparent difference in the amount of PCR product between the JMaP cell line and unstimulated PBMC has  Discussion The studies reported herein represent the first description of the molecular weight of the cloned human IL-7R.

Nevertheless, the observation that the transcript encoding the full length receptor soluble forms predominatesover those for the truncated and implies that the p90 molecule is the full length formof the cloned IL-7R (not shown). Despite expression of the cloned p90 IL-7R, resting T cells are incapable of proliferating in response to IL-7 (Fig. 2) (5, 10, 11). In contrast, activated T cells that express the p76 IL-7R are able to proliferate to IL-7.  The p76 IL-7R binds IL-7 with dual (high and low) affinity, withKd values similar to those of the p90 IL-7R (5). This observation is supported by the fact that both the p90 and p76 IL-7R can be cross-linked with equal efficiencies, using as little as 0.1 nM IL-7; demonstrating that the affinities with which these receptors bind IL-7 are comparable, and at least 1,000-fold higher than that reported for the ultra-low affinity IL-7R (not shown). Additional evidence to suggest that these molecules are distinct from the ultra low affinity IL-7R is given by our own attempts to cross-link 12s--I-IL-7 THP-1 and RPMI 1788 cells (not to shown). These lines express high levels of the ultra-low affinity IL-7R (7), but do not reveal any cross-linked species under conditions in which the p90 and p76 IL-7Rare detected in T cells. Despite their similar binding affinities, our data show that the p90 and p76 IL-7R are simply differently glynot cosylated forms of a single IL-7R. Although peptide mapping studies might have provided further evidence of the relationship of these two molecules, in our hands these studies have proven difficult. Peptide mapping studies of receptors cross-linked to 1251-IL-7, forinstance, are problematic. IL-7 has only one tyrosine residue, close to the N-terminus (18), and thus only one labeling site for ''I, and this label is rapidly lostafter digestion of cross-linked complexes with CNBr andN-bromo-succinimide.Studies using 35S-metabolically labeled cells have failed to label the p90 and p76 IL-7R to high enough specific activity for use in peptide mapping studies, and surface labeling of cells exI2'I pressing the p90 and p76 IL-7R with appears to inhibit IL-7 binding, so that isolation labeled receptor:IL-7 comof plexes using anti-IL-7 antibodies has not been possible. Nevertheless, our studies show that theextracellular domains of the p90 and p76 IL-7R are distinct from one another. Evidence from cell surface staining and immunoprecipitation studies with antibodies to the cloned IL-7R also exclude the possibility that the p76 IL-7R represents thepreviouslydescribedtruncatedform of cloned the IL-7R that is formed by a splicing event within the cytoplasmic domain of the cloned IL-7R (8, 17).Moreover, PCR analysis using primers that amplify the extracellular domain of the cloned receptor have failed to reveal any alternate transcripts, arguing against the possibility that the splicing p76 IL-7Ris produced as a result of an undescribed event within this region. The hypothesis that direct proteolytic cleavage of preformed p90 IL-7R isresponsible for the appearance of the p76 receptor can also be excluded by these studies, as kinetic analyses (Fig. 1) demonstrate that the p76 IL-7R is expressed before levels of the p90 decline. The alternative, and most interesting explanation, is that the p76 and p90 IL-7R are products of distinct genes.This theory is supported by recent studies showing that cells activated in the presence of CyA or FK506 continue to  4762  CHARACTERIZATION O A NOVEL HIGH AFFINITY IL-7 RECEPTOR F  express the p90 receptor at preactivation levels, but fail to express the p76receptor (12). As both CyA and FK506 are known to block transcriptional activation of several T-cell genes (19, 20), these data suggest that transcriptional control of p90 and p76 IL-7R expression is different, implying that these receptorsare indeed the products of separate genes. In agreement, the data presented herein show that expression of these two receptors differs dependingon the activation state of the T cell. Expression of the p76 IL-7R correlated with the ability of activated T cells to proliferate to IL-7 in vitro. This relationship is also seen with IL-7-responsive human T-cell clones, which express predominantly the p76 IL-7R (5). Moreover, unstimulated human thymocytes also express the p76 IL-7R (Page et al., manuscript in preparation). This finding may therefore explain previous observations that human thymocytes canproliferate to IL-7 in the absence of co-mitogens (21, 22). The correlation of p76 IL-7R expression with IL-7 growth responsiveness suggests that the signals delivered to the T cell via the p90 and p76 receptors differ. Thus, binding of IL-7 to the p90 IL-7R on resting T cells appears sufficient to trigger expression of CD25 and other activation Ag, but not proliferation. In contrast, once activated, the cell expresses the p76 IL-7Rand can proliferateto IL-7, suggesting that the signals for proliferation are dependent on the expression of this molecule. Accordingly, PBMC activated in the presence of CyA or FK506 do not acquire p76 IL-7R expression, and correspondingly do not proliferate in response to IL-7 (12). Nevertheless, our own observations have also suggested that whereas the p76 IL-7R is essential, it may not be sufficient for IL-7-driven proliferation. PBMC cultured for 5 days in media alone can also express p76 IL-7R. Howthe ever, these cellswill not proliferate to IL-7. Thus, the IL-7R responsible for mediating proliferative signalsmay contain other componentsin addition to the p90 and p76 IL-7 binding species. Nonligand binding moieties are important components of a number of cytokine receptors including those for IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, and GM-CSF (23-25). Hence, the presence of additional, nonligand binding components in the IL-7R would not be entirely unexpected. In agreement with this hypothesis, our own immunoprecipitation studies have revealed a receptor-associated speciesof200 kDa, distinct from the higher molecular weight species seen in affinity cross-linking studies, which is coprecipitated with the p90 IL-7R (Fig. 5). The close association of this species with the IL-7R suggests a role in IL-7 mediated responses (Page et al., manuscript in preparation). At present, however, the precise relationship between this p200 species the p90 versus the p76 IL-7R and is unclear. Investigations are in progress within this laboratory to address this question. In summary, we have examined IL-7R structure on human T-cell populations and have demonstrated the presence  of a novel, 76-kDa, high affinity IL-7 bindingmolecule that appears to be distinct from the recently described ultra low affinity IL-7R7 also from all previously described forms and of the cloned IL-7R. In fact, one intriguing point raised by these studies asks whether both membrane bound forms of the cloned receptor are actually expressed in vivo. Although PCR analysis reveals transcripts predicted to encode both these receptors (not shown) we have only been able to detect either by cross-linking analysis or immunoprecipitation, the presence of a single 90-kDa form the cloned receptor. We can of only conclude therefore that either the alternative transcript is not translated, and hence is never expressed on the cell surface, or that it is expressed in amounts below the level of detection of the systems used in these studies. Our observations set the T cell IL-7R apart from many othercytokine receptors, including those that contain a single ligand binding component, e.g. IL-3,4,5,6 (26), and also from the IL-2R that contains two ligand binding components with different affinities (27). Even comparisons with cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF, which have two distinct high affinity receptors (2&amp;30), are difficult, for, although each of these receptorsmay mediate a distinct function (cytotoxicity T cell proliferation for the TNFR-I and TNFR-I1 respectively) (31) they are often not expressed on the same cell type. Thus, the situation where two distinct high affinity receptors, specific for a single cytokine are differentially expressed on the same cell type, and are associated with specific effects of that cytokine within the same cell, may reveal a novel mechanism for modulating cytokine function.

									<Abstract>We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclin-dependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdi1). In yeast, Cdi1 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human Cdc2, Cdk2, and Cdk3, but not with Ckd4. In HeLa cells, Cdi1 is expressed at the G1 to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdi1 bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdi1 removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wild-type Cdi1 delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdi1 phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdi1 as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases.</Abstract>

<BodyText>Cell, Vol. 75, 791-803,  November  19, 1993, Copyright  0 1993 by Cell Press  Cdil, a Human G l and S Phase Protein Phosphatase That Associates with Cdk2 Jen6 Gyuris,' Erica Golemis,t Helen Chettkov, and Roger Brent Department of Molecular Biology Massachusetts General Hospital Boston, Massachusetts 02114 and Department of Genetics Harvard Medical School Boston, Massachusetts 02115 through particular parts of the cell cycle (Meyerson et al., 1992). As the name suggests, Cdk activity depends on association with cyclins, regulatory molecules synthesized at different times during the cell cycle that complex with Cdks. Availability of cyclins often regulates Cdk activity; in S. cerevisiae, the rate-limiting step for the Gl/S transition is thought to be the accumulation of Gl-specific cyclins, including the products of the CLN7, CLN2, CLN3, HSC26, and CL/35 genes (reviewed by Nasmyth, 1993). Mammalian cells also contain a number of cyclins during Gl to S (cyclins Dl , D2, D3, and E; reviewed by Sherr, 1993) and it is likely that changes in their level result in changes in the activity of Cdks present at that time. For example, accumulation of cyclin E and the formation of active cyclin E-CdkP complexes are neccessary for cells to pass from Gl to S (Tsai et al., 1993; Ohtsubo and Roberts, 1993). Cdk activity is also regulated by protein modification. In S. pombe, during G2, Cdc2 complexed with cyclin B is phosphorylated by the Wee1 and Mikl tyrosine kinases on Tyr-15 at the ATP-binding site (reviewed by Nillar and Russell, 1992). The phosphorylated complex cannot hydrolyze ATP until it is dephosphorylated by the Cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase (see Moreno et al., 1989); dephosphorylation occurs after DNA synthesis is complete and allows entry into mitosis. A similar mechanism apparently operates in higher cells (Dunphy and Kumagai, 1991; Gautier et al., 1991; Parker and Piwnica-Worms, 1992). Cdc2 is also modified on at least one other residue, Thr-160, by Cdc2-activating kinase (see Solomon et al., 1993; Poon et al., 1993; Fesquet et al., 1993). Thr-160 phosphorylation is required for binding of cyclins to Cdks and for full Cdk activity (Ducommun et al., 1991; Fesquet et al., 1993; Poon et al., 1993; Solomon et al., 1993). Although the relevance of phosphorylation to events at Gl to S is not clear, Cdk2, which is required for the Gl to S transition, is modified on the equivalent residues (Gu et al., 1992). The cyclins complexed with Cdks also show intricate patterns of phosphorylation, although the significance of these modifications is not known (see, for example, Hall et al., 1993; Koff et al., 1992). These regulatory proteins are modulated by other regulators. For example, in S. pombe and probably in mammalian cells, at G2/M the Wee1 tyrosine kinase is negatively regulated by the Niml product, perhaps in response to signals that DNA replication is complete (see Coleman et al., 1993, and references therein). In S. cerevisiae, at GlIS, the activity of Gl cyclins is negatively regulated in response to a proliferation-inhibiting stimulus, a factor. In this case, Fus3 (Elion et al., 1990) phosphorylates Far1 (Chang and Herskowitz, 1990) which in turn binds to Clnl-Cdc28 and Cln2-Cdc28 complexes and inhibits their activity(reviewed by Nasmyth, 1993); Fus3 also inhibits CLN3 by an unknown mechanism (Elion et al., 1990). In mammalian cells, the upstream regulatory proteins operative at Gl/S and G2/M are currently not well understood. The understanding of mammalian Cdk regulators  Summary We used the interaction trap, a yeast genetic selection for interacting proteins, to isolate human cyclindependent kinase interactor 1 (Cdil). In yeast, Cdil interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases, including human CdcP, Cdk2, and Cdk3, but not with Ckd4. In HeLa cells, Cdil is expressed at the Gl to S transition, and the protein forms stable complexes with Cdk2. Cdil bears weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. In vitro, Cdil removes phosphate from tyrosine residues in model substrates, but a mutant protein that bears a lesion in the putative active site cysteine does not. Overexpression of wildtype Cdil delays progression through the cell cycle in yeast and HeLa cells; delay is dependent on Cdil phosphatase activity. These experiments identify Cdil as a novel type of protein phosphatase that forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases. Introduction In eukaryotes, the cell cycle proceeds through two major checkpoints, one before the transition from Gl to S, the other before G2 to M. Many events that result in progression through the G2 checkpoint are intracellular, such as thecompletionof DNAsynthesis(Enochand Nurse, 1991). By contrast, many events that result in passage from Gl into S, such as the binding of positive and negative growth regulatory proteins to receptors in the cell membrane, are extracellular (Pardee, 1989). In yeast, progress through both checkpoints depends on a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk), encoded in Schizosaccharomyces pombe by cdc2 and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by CDC28 (reviewed by Nasmyth, 1993). Cell cycle progression in mammals requires multiple Cdks. Cdc2 (Lee and Nurse, 1987) is required for the G2 to M transition (Riabowol et al., 1989). The Gl to S transition requires another Cdk, Cdk2 (reviewed by Pagan0 et al., 1993; Tsai et al., 1993). Recently, more Cdks have been isolated, including Cdk3, Cdk4, and Cdk5. Although the function of these proteins is not known, it is widely thought that they may also regulate progression ` Present address: Mitotix Incorporated. Massachusetts 02139. 1 Kendall Square, Cambridge,  TPresent address: Fox Chase Center for Cancer Research, 7701 Burholme Avenue, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.  Cell 792  and their upstream regulators is important, however, because these proteins will likely help modulate Cdk activity by coupling it to signals inside and outside the cell. Modulation of Cdk activity during Gl is of particular interest because it is during this period that cells typically decide whether to commit to a new round of passage through the cell cycle, to withdraw temporarily from the cycle and enter a nondividing resting state, or to withdraw permanently from the cell cycle and terminally differentiate (Pardee, 1989). Failures in the mechanisms that govern these Gl decisions may underlie some kinds of aberrant differentiation and cancer. To understand further mammalian Gl decisions, we have sought to isolate proteins involved in the process. To this end we developed a selection (the interaction trap) for genes encoding proteins that bind to known proteins, a selection that relies on work by Fields and Song (1989). We used the trap to isolate a protein, Cdk interactor 1 (Cdil), that binds human Cdks. Cdil has weak sequence similarity to known tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases, but is different enough to suggest that it belongs in a novel sequence class. Sequence similarity is most pronounced in an 11 residue region that spans the putative active site. In vitro, Cdil dephosphorylates tyrosines in model substrates. Cdil phosphatase activity is inhibited by chemical inhibitors and abolished by mutation of a critical cysteine in the active site. When overexpressed, Cdil retards cell cycle progression in yeast and mammalian cells. Cell cycle retardation depends on phosphatase activity. CD/l mRNA is maximally expressed during Gl and GlIS, and the protein forms stable complexes with a Cdk, Cdk2, operative at this time. Cdil does not increase the kinase activity of tyrosine-phosphorylated cyclin-Cdk2 complexes. These experiments are consistent with the idea that the Cdil phosphatase might affect cell cycle progression either by controlling phosphorylation of Cdk2-associated proteins or by acting together with Cdk2 complexes on common substrates. Results Interaction Trap To isolate Cdil, we developed a general transcriptionbased selection for protein-protein interactions. This interaction trap is an outgrowth of our attempts to use the modular nature of transcription activators (Brent and Ptashne, 1985; Ma and Ptashne, 1988; Triezenberg et al., 1988) to detect protein-protein interactions in yeast. It incorporates a seminal suggestion by Fields and Song (1989) (see Discussion), who, together with other groups, have also developed effective methods for transcription-based interaction cloning (Chien et al., 1991; Dalton and Treisman, 1992; Durfee et al., 1993; Vojtek et al., 1993). Development of the trap, shown in Figure la, required careful attention to three classes of components: a fusion protein that contains a LexA DNA-binding domain and that is known to be transcriptionally inert (the "bait"); reporter genes that have no basal transcription and that are bound by the bait; and the proteins encoded by an expression library, which are expressed as chimeras and whose amino termini con tain  an activation domain and other useful moieties (the "prey"). Relevant design criteria are detailed in Experimental Procedures. Isolation of Cdil We isolated Cdil as described (see Experimental Procedures). We rescued library plasmids from cells in which both reporter genes showed galactose-dependent transcription, assigned the plasmids to three different classes by restriction mapping, identified plasmids from each class that contained the longest cDNA inserts, and verified by Western analysis with anti-epitope antiserum that the plasmids directed the synthesis of fusion proteins (data not shown). Detailed restriction mapping and partial DNA  b  Figure 1. Interaction  Trap  (a) (Left) EGY49-~1940 contains two reporter genes, LexAopLEU2 and LexAop-/acZ, and a transcriptionally inert LexA-CdcP bait. Synthesis of library proteins is induced by growing the yeast in galactose medium. (Middle) The library protein does not interact with the transcriptionally inert bait; the reporter genes are not transcribed; the cell does not form a colony on Leu medium, and it contains no f%gafacto sidase activity (act). (Right) The library protein interacts with the bait, and both reporters are active; the cell forms a colony on Leu- medium; cells in the colony have Pgalactosidase and are blue on X-Gal medium. (b) The pJG4-5 library plasmid and the invariant 107 amino acid moiety it encodes. This moiety carries amino to carboxyl termini, an ATG, an SV40 nuclear localization sequence (PPKKKRKVA; Kalderon et al., 1994) the 842 transcription activation domain (Ma and Ptashne, 1997) and the HA1 epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA; Green et al., 1992). pJG4-5 directs the synthesis of proteins under the control of a derivative of the GAL7 promoter. It carries a 21.rreplicator and a TRPV selectable marker. cDNA is inserted on EcoRI-Xhol fragments. Downstream of the Xhol site, pJG4-5 ccntains the AD/-/l transcription terminator.

We introduced a library plasmid that expressed tagged Cdil into GALACTOSE CONTROL GLUCOSE EGY46-~1840 derivatives that contained different baits. We streaked eight individual transformants of the Cdil-transformed bait strain (horizontal streaks) or the same bait strain plus the library vector as a control (adjacent vertical streaks) onto a master plate, and we replica plated it onto each of three plates: control, UraTrp- His- glucose, on which all strains grow; glucose, Ura- Trp- His- Leu- glucose, which selects for the transcription of the LexAopLEU2 reporter; and galactose, Ura-. Trp- His- Leu- galactose, which selects for transcription of the LexAopLEU2 reporter and on which Cdil is expressed. Baits were Leti-CdcP (I), LexABicoid (2). LexA-Max (3) LexA-Cln3 (4) LexAFus3 (5), and LexA-c-Myc-C-term (6). Note that on glucose the Cln3 bait weakly activated the LexAopLEU2 reporter, but that on galactose the Bicoid Cdc2 Bait protein: inferiority of the carbon source and diminished bait expression from the AD/f1 promoter (Brent Marker (kD) 12345678 and Ptashne, 1964)eliminated this background. 68 ` :_ (b) In immunoprecipitations. We grew 100 ml culturesof EGY46thatwntainedaCdil-expressing library plasmid and either LexA-CdcP or LexABicoid in gala&amp;se or glucose medium and then prepared cell extracts as described (Wittenberg and Reed, 1966). Extract (5 ul) was taken as a control, and rabbit anti-LexA antiserum (15 ul) was used to immunoprecipitate LexAfusion pro teins as described (Wiienberg and Reed, 1966). Pellets were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer, run on a 12.5% SDS protein gel, and blotted 14.3 onto nitrocellulose. Tagged Cdil was identified by Western analysis of the blotted proteins with the 120X monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibcdy (Ausubel et al., 1967-1993).

Cdil Specifically Interacts with CdcP  sequencing showed that two of the recovered cDNA classes were previously identified genes CKSlhs and CKSPhs, the human homologs of the!% pombesucl' product (Richardson et al., 1990). Sequence of the third cDNA class showed it to be a previously unidentified gene. We called this gene CD/l and its protein product Cdil. We expressed activation-tagged Cdil in a panel of EGY48derived strains containing different baits to test the reproducibility and specificity of its interaction (Figure 2a). As judged by the LEU2 and IacZ transcription phenotypes, Cdil interacted specifically with LexA-CdcP and did not interact with LexA-c-Myc-C-term, LexA-Max, LexA-Bicoid, LexA-Cln3, or LexA-Fus3(Figure2a). Cdil did, however, interact with other Cdks (see below). Specificity of the Cdil-Cdc2 interaction was confirmed by physical criteria: in vitro, anti-LexA antiserum precipitated epitopecontaining proteins from yeast extracts that contained LexA-Cdc2 and Cdil , but not from extracts that contained LexA-Bicoid and Cdil (Figure 2b, lane 5); the mobility of the precipitated proteinswas identical tothatof immunoreactive Cdil bands in extracts of yeast that contained tagged Cdil but were not precipitated (Figure 2b, lanes 3 and 7).  The Cdil Protein CD/l was isolated from 12 different library plasmids that contained cDNAs of four different lengths. Sequence analysis revealed that all CD/l cDNA inserts contained an open reading frame, and inspection of the sequence of the longest cDNAs revealed an ATG with a perfect match to the consensus translation initiation sequence (PuCCIGATGG; Kozak, 1986) (Figure 3a). Careful analysis of the size of CD/l mRNA in HeLa cells (data not shown) revealed that this ATG occurs between 15 and 45 nt from the 5' end of the CD/l message, suggesting that the longest cDNAs spanned the entire open reading frame, which spans 212 codons. Since isolated CD/l cDNAs by definition encoded proteins that interacted with Cdc2, the sizes of CD/l cDNA inserts from this hunt necessarily localized the portion of the protein sufficient for interaction with Cdc2 to the carboxy-terminal - 170 amino acids of Cdil The Cdil sequence (Figure 3a) revealed previously identified protein motifs. First, at the amino terminus, 19 out of 35 amino acids are either proline, glutamic acid, serine, or threonine. Proteins that contain these stretches, called PEST sequences, are degraded rapidly (Rogers et al., 1986) and this stretch of Cdil is more enriched in these amino  Cell 794  a  b  Figure 3. CD/l Coding Sequence and Deduced Protein Sequence The EcoRl adaptor, poly(l) tail, and the Xhol site at the 3' end are not shown. Sequence contains six potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (S/T-X-X-D/E; Pinna, 1990) at 10, 14, 15, 60, 116, and 170; three potential protein kinase C sites (SIT-X-RIK; Woodgett et al., 1966) at 170, 162, and 200; and a weak match to the Cdk consensus site (Z-S/TP-X-Z, where X is polar and 2 generally basic; Moreno and Nurse, 1990) at 162.  Figure 4. Comparison of Cdil to Other Protein Tyrosine and Dual Specificity Phosphatases (a) Comparison of Cdil and human placental protein tyrosine phosphatase 16 (PTPlb; Charbonneau et al., 1969). Sequences were aligned by the GAP algorithim (Pearson and Lipman, 1966). Vertical lines indicate identity; colons and periods indicate conserved changes. Highly conserved residues found in all phosphatases are indicated by asterisks (Freeman et al., 1992). (b) Comparison of the active site region of Cdil to the active site region of other tyrosine phosphatases as aligned by Gautier et al. (1991). The top block includes human Tcell protein tyrosine phosphatase (HsTCPTP; Cool et al., 1969), human protein tyrosine phosphatase 18 (PTPlB), human leukocyte common antigen-related protein domain 1 (HslAR Di; Streuli et al., 1966), and the S. pombe (SpPYPl; Ottilie et al., 1991), S. cerevisiae(ScPTP1; Guan etal., 1991 b),andvacciniavirus(VVHl)(Guan et al., 1991a) tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases. The bottom block of Cdc25 proteins are from human (HsCdc25; Gaiaktionov and Beach, 1991; Sadhu et al., 1990), Drosophila(Dmstr; Edgarand O' Farrell, 1969), S. cerevisiae (ScMIHl; Russell et al., 1969), and S. pombe (Spcdc25; Russell and Nurse, 1966). In the top block, the highly conserved active site histidine, cysteine, glycine, and arginine residues are shown in bold; in the Cdc25 proteins, the conserved glutamic acid and the serine that replaces glycine in the active site are also in bold.  acids than the carboxyl termini of the yeast Gl cyclins, in which the PEST sequences contribute to their rapid degradation (see Nasmyth, 1993). Second, the Cdil sequence contains potential sites for phosphorylation by casein kinase II and protein kinase C and a weak match to a site for phosphorylation by CdcP (see the legend to Figure 3a). Third, Cdil shows weak similarity to protein phosphatases such as human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (Figure 4a; Charbonneau et al., 1989). The similarity is strongest in residues 138-148, which show a good match to the tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatase active site consensus sequence, (IN)HCXAGXXR(SIT)G (Figure 4b; Charbonneau and Tonks, 1992). However, with few exceptions (Guan et al., 1991a; lshabashi et al., 1992), known nonreceptor tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases seem to have two functional regions: an -200 residue catalytic domain and a unique variable-sized so-called regulatory region thought to be important for subcellular localization and regulation of activity (see Charbonneau and Tonks, 1992). Full-length Cdil is about the size of an isolated catalytic domain. These facts suggested that if Cdil were a protein phosphatase, it would be one of unusual type.  Protein Phosphatase Activity of Cdil We tested the ability of Cdil to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine-containing substrates. We altered the Cdil codon corresponding to the catalytic cysteine (Pot and Dixon, 1992) in the tyrosine phosphatase active site consensus  Cdil, 795  a CdkP-Interacting  Protein Phosphatase  a 0.R 0.7 0.6 :s 0.5 ;; 0.4 0 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 pNPP  b Raytide  Figure 5.

We produced Cdil and Cdil-Cl40S in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions and purified them to -90%-950/o homogeneity, as judged on Coomassie-stained SDS protein gels (data not shown). We used the purified proteins in phosphatase assays with model substrates. First, we utilized the chromogenic substrate para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP; Sigma). Wildtype Cdil efficiently hydrolyzed pNPP. Hydrolysis increased linearly as a function of Cdil concentration (Figure 5a). Cdil-C140S did not catalyze detectable pNPP hydrolysis (Figure 5a). Sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of the known phosphotyrosine-specific phosphatases (Charbonneau and Tonks, 1992), effectively blocked hydrolysis by wild-type Cdil (Figure 5a). In 2 hr incubations, 1 molecule of GST-Cdil catalyzed hydrolysis of - 140 pNPP molecules(l.2 mollmin). On a molar basis, Cdil was 812 times more active than similarly purified full-length h' uman Cdc25C (data not shown). We then tested the ability of Cdil to dephosphorylate a.peptide substrate. For this purpose we labeled a peptide (Raytide; Oncogene Sciences, Incorporated, Manhasset, New York) with c-Src tyrosine kinase and [y-"P]ATP. We incubated labeled peptide in the presence or absense of Cdil and measured released 32P04 (see Experimental Procedures). Results with this substrate were similar to those with pNPP. Wild-type Cdil efficiently removed phosphate from the peptide. Sodium vanadate inhibited dephosphorylation. Cdil-Cl40S displayed no activity (Figure 5b). We also tested whether Cdil functioned as aserine/threonine phosphatase by determining whether it could remove phosphates from 32P-labeled Hi histone phosphorylated by CdcP; in our hands, it did not (data not shown). The above results demonstrate that Cdil is a protein tyrosine phosphatase and suggest that it is not active against serines and threonines. Cdil Expression in HeLa Cells Because it interacts with Cdks, we explored the possibility that the Cdil phosphatase might affect cell cycle progres sion.  We first examined Cdil expression during the cell cycle. We synchronized exponentially growing adherent HeLa cells by two cycles of treatment with high concentrations of thymidine to arrest them in late Gl, followed by release from this block by exposure to normal concentrations of thymidine, measured their progression through the cell cycle by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Figure Sa), and isolated RNA at different times. These cells entered S phase more slowly after release from block than reported for suspension HeLa cells (Lew et al., 1991). As is shown in Figure 6b, expression of CD/l mRNA peaks during late Gl and early S. Accumulation of Cdil protein follows the same pattern, as judged by Western blots with anti-Cdil antiserum (data not shown). In these experiments, two reference mRNAs showed the expected time of expression: cyclin E mRNA was expressed late in Gl and disappeared by late S phase (Lew et al., 1991) while cyclin Bl mRNA was expressed later, appearing in S phase and disappearing in M (Pines and Hunter, 1989). This timing of expression suggested that Cdil phosphatase might function during late Gl, during the Gl to S transition, or during early S. To test this idea, we stably transfected HeLa cells with a plasmid that expressed Cdii from the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat and includes the neo resistance gene. Compared with the vector, the Cdil-expressing construction did not yield a reduced number of G418-resistant transformants. However, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of DNA in Cdil-expressing transformants showed a significant and reproducible increase in the proportion of cells in Gl or early S relative to control populations (Figure 6c), suggesting that Cdil overexpression may retard passage through these phases of the HeLa cell cycle. Cdil Expression in Yeast Cells Cdil also inhibited cell cycle progression in yeast. Cultures of S. cerevisiae that expressed Cdil increased their cell number and optical density more slowly than control populations (Figure 7a; data not shown). Microscopic examination of these cells showed that, compared with controls,  Cell 796  Figure 6.

Lane labels show times in hours after release. (c) Effect. HeLa cells were transfected either with pBNCdi1 (see Experimental Procedures), which directed the synthesis of Cdil, or with vector alone and were analyzed as described in Experimental Procedures. The Gl midpoint is defined as the mode of the distribution of each graph; the modes on the two panels are of different heights (272 counts for cells transformed with the vector, 101 counts for cells that contain Cdil); the broadened peak in the Cdil cells reflects the increased proportion of the population containing appproximately 1 x DNA content. Results of a typical run are shown.  Cdil-expressing cells were larger and, when stained with DAPI, that the nuclei of some of the largest cells were not condensed (data not shown). Less than 10% of the cells in Cdil-expressing populations showed buds, as opposed to 40% of the cells in the control population, suggesting that more of the cells in the Cdil-expressing population were in Gl and that Cdil overexpression causes a retardation in passage through the cell cycle similar to its effect in mammalian cells (Figure 7b). We examined two models for Cdil inhibition of cell cycle  progression. First, becausecdil interacts with Cdc28 (see below), its growth retardation phenotype might be due to sequestration of yeast Cdc28 into protein complexes that were not competent to cause the cell to traverse Gl and early S. If so, then the phenotype should be reversible by co-overproducing the human Cdc2 against which Cdil was selected. Second, because Cdil is a protein phosphatase, its inhibitory effect might be dependent on its phosphatase activity. To test these ideas, we expressed wildtype Cdil and the Cdil-C140S mutant in cells that  a GLUCOSE GALACTOSE  b 0.4  Figure  7. Effect of Cdil on Yeast Cell Growth (a) Growth rates of cells that expressed Cdil. S. cerevisiae W303 that carried the indicated combinations of Cdil and/or CdcP expression vectors were grown in the indicated media and growth monitored by OD, as described in Experimental Procedures. Note that the Cdil and CdcP expression plasmids together caused some growth inhibition even in glucose medium, which we attribute to leaky expression from the GAL1 promoter derivative on the pJGC1 expression plasmid (J.

Figure 7a shows that coexpression of Cdc2 did not rescue Cdil-dependent growth inhibition. The Cdil-C140S rnutant did not cause growth inhibition, whether it was expressed alone or together with Cdc2 (Figure 7a). Unexpectedly, coexpression of Cdc2 with wild-type Cdil increased the severity of the Cdil-dependent growth inhibition by about 2-fold (Figure 7a). These experiments suggest three conclusions. First, because expression of excess CdcP does not rescue Cdil growth retardation, they suggest that this growth inhibition cannot be explained by simple sequestration of Cdc28 into nonfunctional complexes. Second, because Cdil-dependent growth inhibition is strictly dependent on the phosphatase activity of Cdi, these results suggest that the inhibition is due to dephosphorylation of Cdil substrate(s). Finally, because Cdil-dependent growth inhibition is heightened by coexpression of Cdc2, these results suggest a functional genetic interaction between Cdil and CdcP in addition to the physical interaction. Cdil Activity In Vitro VVe considered two explanations for the genetic interaction between Cdil and Cdks suggested by the yeast coexpression experiments. First, just as CdcP is reported to phosphorylate Cdc25 and increase its phosphatase activity (Hoffman et al., 1993), we thought that Cdc2 might phosphorylate Cdil and increase its activity. We thus tested whether known Cdks could phosphorylate Cdil in vitro. We found that neither Cdc2 nor Cdk2 complexes isolated from HeLacells nor cyclin El-CdkP complexes reconstituted from pure proteins expressed in Sf9 cells (a gift of B. Gabrielli and H. Piwnica-Worms) could phosphorylate GST-Cdil , although these complexes phosphorylated histone Hl (data not shown). Second, we asked whether Cdil activated Cdks. For this purpose we used a cyclin Bl-Cdk2 complex phosphorylated in vitro on Tyr-15 by the human Wee1 tyrosine kinase (a gift of 6. Gabrielli and t-l. Piwnica-Worms). Treatment of this complex with GSTCdil did not increase its histone Hl kinase activity, while treatment with GST-Cdc25C did (data not shown). This suggested that Cdil is unable to remove the inhibitory phosphate from Tyr-15 and to activate the kinase. Thus, although Cdil phosphatase and Cdks interact, these results suggest that neither protein is a substrate for the other.  (Elledge and Spotswood, 1991; Tsai et al., 1991) and Cdk3 (Meyerson et al., 1992), and LexA derivatives of the less closely related human Cdk4 (Hanks, 1987) and yeast Fus3 (Elion et al., 1990). Table 1 shows that activation-tagged Cdil stimulated transcription from these baits to different levels: Cdil activated strongly in strains that contained the human CdcP bait against which it was selected, less strongly in strains that contained S. cerevisiae Cdc28, human Cdk2, or human Cdk3 baits, and only weakly in strains that contained DmCdc2, one of the two Drosophila CdcP homologs. In strains that contained human Cdk4, DmCdcPc, or Fus3 baits, Cdil did not activate at all (Table 1). All kinases with which Cdil interacted contained the so-called PSTAIRE motif, a stretch of amino acids that includes the Cdk catalytic site (Meyerson et al., 1992). Cdil did not interact with Cdk4, which has a similar sequence in this region (PISTVRE; Meyerson et al., 1992), or with FUSS, which has no apparent similarity to this region. Cdil did not interact with DmCdc2c, which contains a PSTAIRE motif but which differs substantially at other residues. This experiment suggested that the partners of Cdil in mammalian cells may be other PSTAIRE-containing Cdks present when Cdil is, such as Cdk2. Association of Cdil with Cdk2 in HeLa Cells To explore the Cdil-Cdk2 interaction, we used anti-Cdil antiserum (tested as described in Experimental Procedures) and other antisera that specifically recognized Cdc2 and Cdk2 (gifts of L.-H. Tsai and E. Harlow) to precipitate complexes containing these proteins from 35S-labeled HeLa cell extracts. Precipitated proteins were separated on SDS gels (Figure 8a). Cdil antiserum brought down major protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 21 kd and 33 kd (Figure 8a, lane 3). These bands were absent from precipitates that used Cdil preimmune serum (Figure 8a, lane 2) and nonspecific rabbit serum (lane 6). The 21 kd band corresponded to Cdil; its mobility was the same as that of in vitro translated Cdil and of immunoprecipitated in vitro translated Cdil (see Experimental Procedures). The 33 kd band had a similar mobility to one of the two major bands immunoprecipitated from HeLa  Table 1.

We of five isolates of each strain grown individual transformants was less Activity  Cdil Interaction with Cdks in Yeast Since Cdil is normally expressed during Gl and its overexpression retards the Gl to S transition, it seemed possible that it might normally form complexes with Cdks other than Cdc2. To determine which Cdks might be Cdil partners, we used the interaction trap to measure the ability of Cdil to interact with a panel of different bait proteins. This panel included LexA derivatives of Cdc2 proteins from yeast (Lorincz and Reed, 1984), humans (Lee and Nurse, 1987), and flies (Jimenez et al., 1990; Lehner and O ' Farrell, 1990), LexA derivatives of human Cdk2  EGY48-JK103 contained tagged different LexA-Cdk baits: human cerevisiae Cdc28 and FUSS; and measured o-galactosidase activity in 2% galactose; variation among than 20%.

Cdil   lysates  with the antiCdk2 antisera(Figure 8a, lane 5). The mobility of these two bands matched published reports in which the 33 kd band corresponds to Thr-l60-phosphorylated Cdk2 (~33~~~7, and the 35 kd band corresponds to CdkP that is not phosphorylated at this residue (~35~~~~; Gu et al., 1992). These results suggested that Cdil might form complexes with ~33, the active form of CdkP. Comparison of the bands in the Cdil precipitation to those in the anti-Cdd precipitation (Figure 8a, lane 4) suggested that in HeLacells Cdil does not associate with CdcP. Cdk2 antiserum did not precipitate detectable amounts of the 21 kd Cdil band (Figure 8a, lane 5) suggesting that Cdil might make essential contacts with the stretch of the Cdk2 carboxyl terminus to which the antiserum was raised. Cdil antiserum brought down other proteins of higher molecular mass. Three of these bands, of apparent molecular masses of 45-63 kd, were also precipitated with antiCdk2 antiserum. From their molecular masses, these bands may be the Cdk2-associated cyclins A (63 kd), 61 (55-56 kd), and E (45-50 kd) (Pines and Hunter, 1989; Draetta and Beach, 1988; Tsai et al., 1993). To confirm the tentative identification of the Cdilassociated 33 kd band as p33cdk2,we subjected the % labeled 33 kd protein band to partial proteolysis with V8 and analyzed the products on SDS gels (Harlow and Lane, 1988). We compared the pattern of bands with that given by similarly treated human Cdk2 synthetized by translation in vitro (see Experimental Procedures). The pattern resulting from digestion of the 33 kd band was identical to that obtained from Cdk2, indicating that in HeLa cells one partner of Cdil is CdkP (Figure 8b, lanes 4-9). This pattern was distinctly different from the pattern resulting from digestion of Cdc2 (Figure Eb, lanes l-3). Discussion Passage of eukaryotic cells through different phases of the cell cycle is dependent on Cdks. Interacting regulatory proteins connect the activity of the Cdks to signals generated inside the cell and to events in the extracellular environment (Sherr, 1993). To understand better cell cycle  regulation in humans, we developed a general yeast transcription genetic selection and used it to isolate proteins that touch Cdks and might modulate their activity or function with them during the cell cycle. This selection, the interaction trap, relies on the fact that eukaryotic transcrip tion activators are often composed of discrete DNAbinding and activation domains and that the activation domain can be brought to the promoter by protein-protein interactions (Brent and Ptashne, 1985; Ma and Ptashne, 1988; Fields and Song, 1989). It is especially dependent on the two-hybrid system proposed by Fields and Song (1989) in that our use of transcription to detect proteins that interact with DNA-bound baits incorporates their suggestion that potential interacting proteins could be detected if they carried activation domains. Several techniques that make use of this suggestion have been developed in a number of labs (Chien et al., 1991; Dalton and Treisman, 1992; Durfee et al., 1993; Vojtek et al., 1993). As demonstrated here and in Zervos et al. (1993) a number of features make the trap particularly useful. First, the reporters have qualitatively different phenotypes: the LexAopLEUP reporter provides a selection, allowing large numbers of potential interactors to be easily surveyed, while the LexAop-/acZ reporter provides a simple secondary test to reject adventitious Lfllf colonies. Second, the reporters have different promoters, which may eliminate false positive proteins that interact with the promoter instead of the bait. Third, the reporter phenotypes differ in their sensitivity, which affects the affinity of the bait-prey interactions they can detect. The LexAop-LEU2 reporter responds to interactions with an apparent Kr, of about 10e6 M, while the different LexAop-IacZ reporters respond with different sensitivities; which lacZ reporter is used is determined by the investigator. Fourth, the activation region on the library proteins is relatively weak, to avoid restrictions in the spectrum of recovered proteins that might be caused by the strong, semitoxic activation domains of GAL4 and VP16 (Gill and Ptashne, 1988; Triezenberg et al., 1988; Berger et al., 1992). Finally, conditional expression from the library vector allows the Leu  Cdil, 799  a Cdk2-Interacting  Protein Phosphatase  and LacZ phenotypes to be unambiguously ascribed to the library protein, diminishing the number of library plasmids that must be excluded by subsequent tests. While useful schemes with some of these attributes have recently been described (e.g., Vojtek et al., 1993), none has the entire set. Because this interactor hunt used a relatively insensitive /acZ reporter, it identified only three proteins, all of which associate strongly with human Cdc2. Two had been previously identified: the CKSl and CKS2 proteins (Richardson et al., 1990), the human homologs of the S. pombe sucl+ product. Cdil, the protein reported here, contains 2' amino acids, of which the carboxy-terminal 170 are 12 sufficient for interaction with Cdc2. Cdil has consensus sites for protein kinase C and casein kinase II. The aminoterminal 35 residues of the protein comprise a PEST sequence (Rogers et al., 1986). Cdil possesses weak sequencesimilarity to the catalytic domain of protein tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases, including similarity to a stretch of amino acids that defines the active site (Charbonneau and Tonks, 1992). From sequence, Cdil is more different from known nonreceptor tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases than these are to one another, and it apparently lacks the regulatory domain found in all these proteins except the VHl-related phosphatases (Charboneau and Tonks, 1992). In vitro, Cdil possesses tyrosine phosphatase activity on model substrates such as pNPP and tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. Cdil activity is inhibited by chemical inhibitors and by a mutation that eliminates a cysteine in the catalytic site. These facts establish that Cdil represents a novel class of human protein phosphatase, which, like S. cerevisiae Cdcl4 and Cdc25, may function in cell cycle progression (Millar and Russell, 1992; Wan et al., 1992). In HeLa cells that express Cdil under the control of a retroviral promoter, the proportion of cells in the population in Gl or early S is increased, suggesting that Cdil overexpression delays progression beyond these stages of the cell cycle. This fact is consistent with the time of its expression, which is strikingly specific for the cell cycle stage: in synchronized populations, CD/l mRNA is highest during Gl and at the Gl to S transition. Expression of Cdil also retards cell cycle progression in S. cerevisiae; again, Cdil increases the proportion of cells in Gl, suggesting that expression retards the Gl to S transition. Retardation requires Cdil phosphatase activity and is enhanced byoverexpression of CdcP. These results indicate that cell cycle retardation by Cdil is not likely due to sequestration of Cdc28 by Cdil into inactive complexes and suggest a functional genetic interaction between Cdil and Cdks. As measured by interaction in yeast, Cdil interacts with different Cdks with very different affinities. All Cdks with which Cdil interacts strongly(Cdc2, Cdk2, and Cdk3) contained a distinctive set of amino acids in the active site, the so-called PSTAIRE motif (Meyerson et al., 1992). To identify those proteins complexed with Cdil in human cells, we immunoprecipitated Cdil-associated proteins from HeLa cells. The apparent molecular mass of one of these (33 kd) suggested that it might be the Thr-160phosphorylated form of Cdk2. We analyzed this protein by partial V8 proteolysis and confirmed that the protein  was Cdk2. We were unable to demonstrate an association of Cdii with other Cdks in HeLa extracts. These experiments demonstrate that Cdil associates with Cdk2, a kinase thought to govern the Gl to S transition, and thus further emphasize that Cdil may influence this transition. The most obvious model for Cdil function, given its association with Cdk2, is that Cdil function might modify Cdk2, dephosphorylating the Tyr-15 equivalent and stimulating kinase activity. However, since we cannot activate tyrosine-phosphorylated Cdk2-containing complexes by treatment with Cdil, we do not think it removes tyrosines from CdkP. A second model is that Cdil dephosphorylates other Cdk2-associated proteins, such as cyclins, thus indirectly affecting Cdk activity; this idea receives support from the fact that complex patterns of cyclin A, Bl, Dl, and E phosphorylation exist (see, for example, Hall et al., 1993; Koff et al., 1992). A third model is that Cdil functions with other members of Cdk2-containing complexes on common substrates. This idea is consistent with the observed functional interaction between Cdil and Cdks in yeast in which coexpression of Cdc2 increases Cdildependent cell cycle retardation. In this view, the proteins complexed with Cdil may provide the regulatory domain that Cdil apparently lacks. Identification of the Cdil substrate(s) will help distinguish among these ideas and in understanding the function of this Cdk2-associated phosphatase during Gl and early S.

These were grown overnight at 30°C in 2% raffinose His- Trp-, collected, washed, and diluted to an OD, of 0.1 into fresh medium that contained either 2% glucuse or 1% galactose plus 1% raffinose. ODs were taken every 2 hr. Interaction Trap Detailed map, sequence, and methodological information is available on request and from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Molecular Biology Internet Gopher server. Baits were produced constitutively from a 2p HIS3' plasmid under the control of the ADHl promoter and contained the LexA carboxy-terminal oligomerization region, which contributes to operator occupancy by LexA derivatives, perhaps by precisely aligning LexA amino termini on adjacent operator half sites (Golemis and Brent, 1992). Note that most LexA derivatives enter the nucleus in concentrations sufficient to permit operator binding, even though LexA derivatives are not specifically nuclear localized unless they contain other signals (Golemis and Brent, 1992; Silver et al., 1986). Baits were made in LexA(l-202)+PL (Ruden et al., 1991). a close relative of pMA42, pSH2-1, and pEG202 (Hanes and Brent, 1989; Ma and Ptashne, 1987; E. G. and R. B., unpublished data) as follows: human CdcP (Lee and Nurse, 1987), Cdk2 (Tsai et al., 1991), and Cdk3 (Meyerson et al., 1992) and S. cerevisiae CDC28 (Lorincz and Reed, 1984) coding sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from plasmids that contained them with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) and were inserted into LexA(l-202)+PL as EcoRI-BamHI fragments. LexA-Cdk4 (Hanks, 1987; Meyerson et  Cell 800  al., 1969) was a gift of K. Visvanathan. These proteins contained two amino acids (EF) between the last amino acid of LexA and the bait moieties, The Drosophila CdcP baits (Lehner and O' Farrell, 1990) were giftsof Ft. Finley. LexA-Fus3(Elion et al., 1990) and LexA-ClnJ(Cross, 1988) were made analogously except they were cloned as BamHl fragments and thus contained five amino acids (EFPGI) between LexA and the fused moieties. All these fusions contained the second codon to the stop codon of each bait. LexA-c-Myc-C-term (which contains the carboxy-terminal 178 amino acids of human c-Myc), LexA-Max (which contains all of the human Max coding sequence), and LexABicoid (amino acids 2-160) a gift of Ft. Finley, have been described (Zervos et al., 1993; Golemis and Brent, 1992). Reporters The LexAop-LEUP construction replaced the yeast chromosomal LEU2 gene. The other reporter, pRB1840, one of a series of LexAopGAL74acZ genes (Brent and Ptashne, 1985; Kamens et al., 1990; S. Hanes, unpublished data), was carried on a 2n plasmid. Basal reporter transcription was extremely low, presumably owing both to the removal of the entire upstream activating sequence from both reporters and to the fact that LexA operators introduced into yeast promoters decrease their transcription (Brent and Ptashne, 1984). Reporters were chosen to differ in sensitivity. The LEU2 reporter contained three copies of the high affinity LexA-binding site found upstream of E. coli co/El (Ebina et al., 1983; Kamens et al., 1990) which presumably bind a total of six dimers of the bait. In contrast, the /acZ gene contained a single lower affinity operator (Brent and Ptashne, 1984) that binds a single dimer of the bait. The operators in the LEU2 reporter were closerto the transcription startpoint than theywerein thelaczreporter. These differences in the number, affinity, and operator position all contribute to that fact that the LEU2 reporter is more sensitive than the /acZ gene. Construction of the EGY48 selection strain will be detailed elsewhere (E. G., unpublished data). Expression Vectors and Library Library proteins were expressed from pJG4-5, a member of a series of expression plasmids designed to be used in the interaction trap and to facilitate analysis of isolated proteins. These plasmids carry the 2n replicator and the TRP 7 marker. pJG4-5, whose construction will be described elsewhere, directs the synthesis of fusion proteins. Proteins expressed from this vector possess the following features: galactose-inducible expression so that their synthesis is conditional, an epitope tag to facilitate detection, a nuclear localization signal to maximize intranuclear concentration to increase selection sensitivity, and an activation domain derived from E. coli (Ma and Ptashne, 1967). chosen because its activity is not subject to known regulation by yeast proteins and because it is weak enough to avoid toxicity (Gill and Ptashne, 1988; Berger et al., 1992) that might restrict the number or type of interacting proteins recovered. In addition to this plasmid, we used two Cdil expression plasmids (J. G., unpublished data). We introduced EcoRI-Xhol Cdil-containing fragments into pJG4-4 to make pJGC4Cdil: Cdil was expressed from this plasmid as a native, unfused protein under the control of the GAL7 promoter. We also introduced EcoRI-Xhol fragments that contained Cdil into pJG4-6 to make pJGC6Cdil: in this case, Cdil was expressed as a fusion protein containing, at its amino terminus, a methionine and the hemagglutinin epitope tag. The oligo(dT)-primed activation-tagged cDNA expression library, whose construction will be described elsewhere, was made from RNA from proliferating HeLa cells grown in 5% serum on plates to 70% confluence, using a modification of the procedure described by Gubler and Hoffman (1993) and Huse and Hansen (1988) (J. G., unpublished data). The library contains 9.8 x 1 O6 individual members, &amp;gt;90% of which contain a cDNA insert whose average size ranges between 1 kb and 2 kb; 25% and 33% of its members express fusion proteins. Cdk Interactor Hunt We began with a EGY46-p1640-pLexA-Cdc2 strain, which contained LexAopLEU2 and LexAop-/acZ reporters and the LexA-Cdd bait. We introduced the library into this strain according to a variation of the procedure of Schiestl and Gietz (1989) (R. Finley, unpublished data). We recovered 1.2 x IO6 transformants on glucose Ura- His Trp- plates, scraped them, suspended them in approximately 20 ml  of 65% glycerol, 10 m M Tris-HCI (pH 7.5) 10 m M MgCl2, and stored the cells in 1 ml aliquots at -8OOC. We determined plating efficiency on galactose Ura- His Trp- after growing 50 ul of cell suspension for 5 hr in 5 ml of YP medium, 2% galactose. For the selection, about 2 x 10' galactose-viable cells were plated on four standard circular 10 cm galactose Ura- HisTrp- Leu plates aftergalactose induction. After 4 days at 30°C, 412 LEU+ colonies appeared. These were collected on glucose Ura- His Trp- master plates and retested on glucose UraHis- Trp- Leu-, galactose Ura- His Trp- Leu, glucose X-Gal Ura- HisTrp-, and galactose X-Gal Ura- His Trp- plates. Of these, 55 colonies showed galactose-dependent growth on Leu media and galactosedependent blue color on X-Gal medium. We rescued plasmid DNAs from these colonies (Hoffman and Winston, 1967) introduced them into E. coli KC8, and collected transformants on Trp- ampicillin plates. We classified library plasmids by restriction pattern on 1.8% agarose, 0.5 x Tris-borate-EDTA gels after digestion with EcoRl and Xhol and either Alul or Haelll. We reintroduced those plasmids from each map class that contained the longest cDNAs into EGY46 derivatives that contained a panel of different baits. Proteins encoded by each of the three cDNA classes interacted specifically with the LexA-Cdc2 bait, but not with other LexA fusion proteins (Figure 2). Mammalian Expression We grew HeLa cells on plates and transfected them (Ausubel et al., 1987-1993) either with a DNA copy of pBNCdi1 (J. G., unpublished data), a derivative of a neo resistance retroviral expression vector (Morgenstern and Land, 1990) that directs synthesis of native Cdil under the control of the Moloney murine leukemia virus promoter, or with vector alone. Cdil expression did not diminish the number of G418resistant cells recovered. We rescued individual (about 20) clones from each transfection and grew them on plates in Dulbecco' modified s Eagle' medium plus 10% calf serum. We resuspended cells from four s Cdil-transfected and four control-transfected clones in 225 nl of 30 nglml trypsin in 3.4 m M citrate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 m M spermine, and 0.5 m M Tris and incubated them on a rotator for 10 min at room temperature. We then added 188 nl of 0.5 mglml of trypsin inhibitor and 0.1 mglml RNAase A, vortexed the suspension, added 186 nl of 0.4 mglml of propidium iodide and 1 mglml spermine, and incubated the samples for 30 min at 4OC. For each sample, we analyzed iO,OOO20,000 events in a Becton-Dickinson fluorescence-activated cell sorter using the CellFIT cell cycle analysis program (version 2.01.2). Cdil and Cdil-C140S We made the Cdil Cys-140 to Ser mutation (Cdil-C14OS) by polymerase chain reaction with overlapping primers and Vent polymerase. essentially as described (Hanes and Brent, 1991) changing TGC at position 140 to TCT. Mutagenesis was verified by sequencing the entire mutant gene. We introduced EcoRI-Xhol fragments containing the wild-type and C14OS coding sequences into a modified pGEX2T vector and expressed and purified the GST fusion proteins essentially as described (Ausubel et al., 1987-l 993). We performed pNPP assays on these proteins in 500 pl of 50 m M Tris-HCI (pH 7.2) 2 m M EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) 8-mercaptoethanol, 20 m M pNPP (Sigma) containing the indicated amount of protein at 30°C. After 2 hr, we stopped the reactions by adding 50 nl of 5 M NaOH and measured OD410. For peptide assays, we labeled Raytide (Oncogene Science), at its tyrosine residue with [y-"PJATP and c-Src tyrosine kinase (Oncogene Science) as described by the supplier. For phosphatase assays, we used lo5 cpm of radioactive ]32P]tyrosine-Raytide in 50 nl reactions as described in Figure 5 and by Streuli et al. (1990). Antibodies and lmmunoprecipltation Rabbit polyclonal antibody to GST-Cdil was produced by East Acres Biologicals, Incorporated (Southbridge, Massachusetts) according to standard methods (Harlow and Lane, 1988). Specificity of the antiserum was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated Cdil (TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system; Promega). GST-Cdil blocked precipitation of this labeled product. Programmed lysate (5 nl) was separately precipitated with 10 nl of Cdil antiserum and 10 ul of Cdil preimmune serum in 500 nl of phosphate-buffered saline in the presence or the absence of an excess (20 ng) of GST-Cdil protein. Metabolic labeling and precipations from subconfluent HeLa cells were performed essentially as described in Harlow and Lane  Cdil, 80' 1  a CdkP-Interacting  Protein Phosphatase  (1988) except that ceils were lysed in 250 m M NaCI, 50 m M HEPESKOH (pH 7.5), 5 m M EDTA, 0.1 m M N&amp;VO,, 50 m M NaF, 0.1% Triton, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonate fluoride, 25 pglml leupeptin, 25 pglml pepstatin for 30 min at 4°C. In control precipitations, GST-Cdl1 blocked precipitation of Cdil and associated proteins. Pellets were run on 11% SDS protein gels that were analyzed either on a Molecular Dynamics image analyzer or by fluorography. For V8 mapping, bands were excised and partially digested in the gel with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease as in Harlow and Lane (1988). Products, together with those resulting from digestion of in vitro translated CdkP and C&amp;2, were separated on 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, dried, and visualized on the image analyzer.

										<Abstract>The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 associates with cyclins A, D, and E and has been implicated in the control of the G1 to S phase transition in mammals. To identify potential Cdk2 regulators, we have employed an improved two-hybrid system to isolate human genes encoding Cdk-interacting proteins (Cips). CIP1 encodes a novel 21 kd protein that is found in cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Cdk2 immunoprecipitates. p21CIP1 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of Cdks and can inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes. Cotransfection experiments indicate that CIP1 and SV40 T antigen function in a mutually antagonistic manner to control cell cycle progression.</Abstract>

Introduction Biochemical and genetic data from several systems have demonstrated that cyclins play a positive role in promoting cell cycle transitions via their ability to associate with and activate their cognate cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) (Murray and Kirschner, 1989; Hunt, 1989; Gautier et al., 1990; Nurse, 1990; Maller, 1991). In particular, the Gl cyclins have been implicated in controlling passage through a period called START in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hunter and Pines, 1991; Sherr, 1993, and references therein) or the restriction point in mammals (Ohtsubo and Roberts, 1993; Dou et al., 1993; Quelle et al., 1993), after which cells become committed to a round of cell division (Pardee, 1989). Thus, passage through the restriction point may be the primary event controlling cell proliferation in somatic tissues. Amplification or alteration of a number of human cyclins (A, Dl, D2, and E) have been observed in human tumors (Keyomarsi and Pardee, 1993; Leach et al., 1993; Sherr, 1993, and references therein). Overexpression of cyclin D or E in nontransformed cells shortens Gl and accelerates entry into S phase (Quelle et al., 1993; Ohtsubo and Roberts, 1993). Antisense and antibody injections indicate that cyclin Dl is required for entry into S phase in human diploid fibroblasts (Baldin et al., 1993; Quelle et al., 1993). Consequently, owing to the implications for understanding cancer (Hunter and Pines, 1991;  Kinases  Sherr, 1993), much attention has been focused upon the regulation of Gl cyclin-Cdk functions. One means by which Cdks exert positive growth control is by inactivating negative regulators of the cell cycle, such as the retinoblastoma gene product Rb. Hypophosphorylated Rb functions during the Gl phase to block the activity of E2F and related transcription factors that are required for the expression of genes involved in S phase (for a review see Nevins, 1992). Hyperphosphorylation of Rb or association with DNA tumor virus oncoproteins such as T antigen results in release of E2F and is correlated with passage into S phase. Extracellular growth promoting and inhibitory signals may be integrated via phosphorylation of Rb. In this model, Cdks act in opposition to cellular phosphatases in a dynamic equilibrium to control Rb phosphorylation. D-type cyclins (D2 and D3) and E-type cyclins can participate directly in Rb phosphorylation at the Gl-S transition (Hinds et al., 1992; Ewen et al., 1993; Dowdyet al., 1993). Introduction of Rb into Rb-deficient SAOS-2 cells leads to cell cycle arrest and the formation of the flat cell phenotype. Introduction of cyclins A, D2, D3, and E (but not Dl or B) together with Rb leads to Rb hyperphosphorylation and cell cycle progression. In vitro, A-, D-, and E-type cyclins in complexes with CdkP and Cdk4 can phosphorylate Rb (Ewen et al., 1993; Kato et al., 1993; Matsushime et al., 1992). Human Cdk2 was originally identified based on its ability to complement a c&amp;28 mutation in S. cerevisiae (Elledge and Spottswood, 1991) and by sequence conservation with Cdc2 (Tsai et al., 1991). The importance of CdkP in the Gl-S transition has been reinforced by a variety of experiments. Interference of Cdk2 function by antibody injections (Pagan0 et al., 1993) or by depletion from Xenopus extracts (Fang and Newport, 1991) results in Gl arrest. Expression of dominant negative forms of Cdk2 (but not CdcP, Cdk4, Cdk5, or Cdk6) also blocks mammalian cells in Gl (E. Harlow and S. van den Heuvel, personal communication). Furthermore, Cdk2 is found in association with Gl cyclins implicated in control of passage through the restriction point (Dl, D3, and E) (Dulic et al., 1992; Koff et al., 1992;Xionget al., 1992). Given thecritical nature of Cdk2 function, one might anticipate that regulatory networks exist that provide additional levels of control of Cdk2 activity. For the cyclin B-CdcP complex, negative and positive regulation is provided by Wee1 and Cdc25, respectively (Gould and Nurse, 1989; Solomon et al., 1990; Parker et al., 1991; Kumagai and Dunphy, 1991). Thus far, analogous regulatory pathways have not been identified for Cdks involved in the Gl-S transition. Recent data indicates that cell cycle arrest by transforming growth factor p (TGFP) occurs throlrgh disruption of a pathway leading to activation of the cyclin E-CdkP complex (Koff et al., 1993). ATGFP-induced inhibitor of this pathway has been postulated to control the activity or integrity of the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex, but the mechanism of this control is unknown.  Cdl 806  OFF  UAS G  HIS3 IacZ PACT cDNA Expression Library Transformation  HisWhite  HIS3 IacZ  His+ Blue  B  Proteins that interact with Cdk2 either as substrates or regulators of Cdk2 activity are likely to have important roles in cell cycle transitions. Recently, a novel group of small proteins have been detected that associate with Gl cyclin-Cdk complexes in nontransformed cells, but their identities and function are unknown (Xiong et al., 1992). Interestingly, one of these, a 21 kd protein, is found associated with many cyclin-Cdk complexes, but this association is disrupted by transformation with T antigen (Xiong et al., 1993). These small proteins are candidate regulators of Cdk activity. To identify genes encoding proteins that associate with CdkP, we have employed the two-hybrid system, which allows detection of interactions via the reconstitution of a functional transcriptional activator in yeast (Fields and Song, 1989; Dut-fee et al., 1993). In this paper we report the identification of a gene referred to as C/P7 (for Cdk-interacting protein) that encodes the aforementioned 21 kd subunit of Cdks. Cipl defines a novel class of protein kinase inhibitor that can block the action of Cdks. We present evidence that p21 and T antigen act in a mutually antagonistic way to control cell cycle progression. Results Strategy To identify genes encoding proteins that associate with Cdk2, we developed an improved version of the two-hybrid system that utilizes a genetic selection for genes encoding interacting proteins coupled with an additional assay to eliminate false positives. The genetic selection employed is shown in Figure 1A. Although the dual His+ selectionP-galactosidase screen has eliminated many false positives, a low percentage survive the selection at a rate that varies with the target protein (Durfee et al., 1993). False positives are defined as library clones that activate transcription in cells expressing fusions unrelated to the target protein. To improve further the elimination of false positives, a mating assay was developed. The general strategy is the following. Once positives have been identified (Trp+Leu' His+, /acZ+), a genetic selection, cycloheximide resistance (cyh' is employed to select for loss of ), the plasmid containing the target fusion. The selection strain, Y190, is cyh' but the TRW-Gal4 (amino acids , 1-147) DNA-binding domain fusion vector, pAS2 (Figure 1 B), contains the CYH2 gene that confers cycloheximide sensitivity on a resistant host (Sikorski and Boeke, 1991). After selection on cycloheximide media, the resulting strain is Trp-Leu+, maintains the LEU2 library plasmid, and can now be mated to Y187 strains of the opposite mating type that express other unrelated proteins as Gal4(1-147) fusions (Trp*Leu-). Diploids from the mating are selected (Trp+Leu+) and screened for the ability to produce P-galactosidase. Plasmids from parental strains that fail to activate transcription with unrelated Gal4 fusions in the mating assay are chosen for further analysis, as indicated in Figure 1C.

Transformants (2 x 106) were placed under selection, and rare surviving colonies were screened for their ability to produce P-galactosidase. From 25 His+ blue colonies, 14 contained plasmids that activated/acZtranscriptiononlyin thepresenceofGal4(1147) fusions with Cdk family members. These fell into two classes, based on sequence analysis and interacting properties (Table l), and are referred to as C/P7 and CIP2. In this paper, we have focused on ClPl. CIP2, which encodes a 212 residue protein displaying limited sequence identity with protein tyrosine phosphatases, will be described elsewhere. Analysis of the C/P1 cDNA The DNA and deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the longest C/PI cDNA (2.1 kb) is shown in Figure 2. It encodes a novel arginine-rich protein of 164 amino acids (18,107 daltons) bearing no significant homology to known proteins. In vitro translated Cipl migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 21 kd in an SDSpolyacrylamide gel (see below). While there were no inframe termination codons preceding the putative initiating methionine (nucleotide 74) peptide mapping and immunoblotting data presented below further confirmed the authenticity of the open reading frame. Sequence analysis of C/P7 cDNAs identified the points of fusion with the Gal4 activation domain as Arg-(-25) Arg-(-lo), and Arg-(+20), indicating that the CdkP interaction domain resides in the last 144 amino acids of Cipl. A putative nuclear localization signal is located between residues 140-157. The C/P7 mRNA is approximately 2.1 kb in length and is ubiquitously expressed in all adult human tissues, although r&amp;fold lower levels were observed in brain (data not shown). Furthermore, C/P7 mRNA levels do not vary  significantly through the cell cycle in synchronized normal human breast epithelial cells (Keyomarsi and Pardee, 1993) (data not shown). Cips Form Complexes with Cdks In Vitro To confirm further the apparent in vivo association of Cipl with Cdks, in vitro association assays were performed (Figure 3) using in vitro translated Cdk2 and Cdc2 and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Cipl. Immobilized Ckshs-1 , the human homolog of p13*"c' and GST alone were used as +, positive and negative controls, respectively. Ckshs-1 is known to bind both monomeric and cyclin-associated Cdc2 and Cdk2 with extremely high efficiency (Draetta et al., 1987; Elledge et al., 1992). GST-Cipl binds CdkP to an extent comparable to that observed with Ckshs-1 (Figure 3A), although the concentration of GST-Cipl on the Sepharose beads employed was lo-fold lower than that of Ckshs-1. Cipl also associates with Cdc2, but in this case, binding efficiency is substantially weaker than with Ckshs-1. It is not clear at present why Cipl does not interact effectively with CdcP in the two-hybrid system (Table l), but this may reflect the existence of competing CdcPbinding proteins in yeast. To examine interactions with other Cdks, in vitro binding reactions were performed using a representative panel of in vitro translated kinases, including Cdk3, Cdk5, PLSTIRE, PCTAIRE-1, PCTAIRE-2 (Meyerson et al., 1992) and p40Moi5, the catalytic subunit of CdcBactivating kinase (Poon et al., 1993; Solomon et al., 1993). Among the kinases examined, CdkP and Cdk3 bind Cipl with the highest efficiency (Figure 36). In the experiment shown, Cdk3 bound somewhat less efficiently than did Cdk2, but in replicate experiments the extent of association with Cipl was equal.

While we did not directly examine Cdk4 binding in vitro in this experiment, in other experiments we have not detected binding to monomeric Cdk4. However, functional evidence for an interaction of Cipl with cyclin D2-Cdk4 is provided below. We cannot exclude the possibility that one or more of the kinases that do not associate with GST-Cipl in vitro (i.e., Cdk4) can associate with Cipl in vivo. For example, it is possible that association with the appropriate cyclin partner or modification of the Cdk or Cipl could greatly enhance the affinity of Cipl for particular kinase subunits. Cipl Is Found in Association with Multiple Cyclin-Cdk Complexes in Human Diploid Fibroblasts  Having demonstrated  in vitro association, we sought to  examine whether Cipl was associated with Cdk2 in vivo. lmmunoprecipitation of cell lysates from [35S]methioninelabeled human diploid fibroblasts using anti-Cdk2 and anti-cyclin A antibodies revealed the presence of a 21 kd protein not found in control immune complexes derived from preimmune seraor an antisera unrelated to antLCdk2 (Figure 4A). This protein comigrates with Cipl produced by in vitro translation. The mobility of Cipl and its ability to bind Cdk2 in vitro suggest that C/P7 might encode the 21 kd protein identified in cyclin and Cdk immunoprecipitates from WI38 human diploid fibroblasts (Xiong et al., 1992, 1993). The relationship between Cipl and p21 was examined by both biochemical and immunological methods. Protease V8 fragments generated from [%]methioninelabeled p21 isolated from Cdk2 and cyclin A immune complexes were identical to that found for in vitro translated Cipl, where two major peptide products are evident (Figure 46, right panel). As the resolution achieved in this experiment did not allow comparison with previously reported V8 maps for p21 (Xiong et al., 1992, 1993), additional mapping experiments were performed on in vitro translated Cipl (Figure 48, left panel). The pattern of Cipl peptides is identical to that of ~21. In shorter exposures, it is evident that the major more slowly migrating proteolytic product is a closely spaced doublet. This doublet is often not resolved in the p21 maps obtained by Xiong et al. (1992, 1993). In addition, a transient proteolytic product migrating between Cipl and the doublet is evident in both the Cipl map (Figure 48) and the p21 map (Xiong et al., 1992). Taken together, these data confirm that the p21 protein previously identified in Cdk2 complexes is Cipl To analyze further the Cipl association with Cdks in vivo, polyclonal antibodies were made to bacterial Cipl Extracts from fibroblasts were treated with either preimmune immunoglobulin G or anti-cyclin A antibodies crosslinked to protein A-Sepharose beads or Ckshs-1 beads, and precipitated complexes were immunoblotted with affinity-purified antiCip1 antibodies. A 21 kd protein comigrating with bacterial Cipl was detected in the cyclin A and Ckshs-1 complexes that was not present in immune complexes from preimmune sera (Figure 4C). This 21 kd protein was not detected in blots of cyclin A immune complexes probed with preimmune sera, indicating that the 21 kd protein detected in anti-cyclin A immunoprecipitates is specific for the anti-Cipl antisera. Unfortunately, although these antisera work well on Western blots, they do not work for immunoprecipitation of Cipl, precluding reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments. We also examined whether other cyclin complexes also contain Cipl Extracts were immunoprecipitated with either preimmune sera or anti-cyclin A antibodies, and the supernatants from the cyclin A immunoprecipitate sequentially immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin Dl and anti-cyclin E antibodies. All three cyclin immune complexes contain a protein at 21 kd that reacts with affinity-purified anti-Cipl antibodies (Figure 4D), with more Cipl found in the cyclin D complexes. This may explain the low levels of kinase activity previously observed in cyclin D immunocomplexes (Xiong et al., 1992). These results are in agreement with the results of Xiong et al. (1993) for pPl-Cdk associations using immunoprecipitation of cyclin-Cdk complexes from la Cipl  809  Is an Inhibitor of Gi Cyclin-Dependent  Kinases  ~cyclin A -w  extract  CdkZ  +  -14  a-Cipl  Preimmune  B  Cipl  -+  f-igure 4.

The antiserum labeled C is unrelated to Cdks and was used as an additional negative control. In vitro translation products for Cipl, Cdk2, and cyclin A were run on the same gel. A slightly reduced apparent Cipl mobility is due to gel distortion by a large quantity of a 14 kd protein present in reticulocyte lysates. (6) Protease V8 map of in vitro translated Cipl compared with ~21 isolated from CdkP and cyclin A immune complexes in (A). Quantities of protease V8 used are indicated. Lower amounts of in vitro translated Cipl were used in the right panel to approximate the levels of Cipl isolated from immune complexes. Exposure times were 4 days (left panel) and 3 weeks (right panel). (C) Cell extracts (- 1 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with either preimmune beads, anti-cyclin A beads, or Ckshs-1 beads. Associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using antiCip1 antibodies or preimmune sera. As controls, total E. coli lysates from cells expressing Cipl (- 50 ng) and cells lacking the Cipl expression plasmid were included. Exposure time was 20 min. (D) Cell extracts (-3 mg) were immunoprecipitated with either preimmune or anti-cyclin A antibodies cross-linked to protein A beads, and the supernatant from the cyclin A sample was sequentially immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin Dl and anti-cyclin E antibodies. In each case, immune complexes were collected on 20 ~1 of protein A-Sepharose beads, and washed immune complexes were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-Cipl antibodies. Anti-cyclin Dl and E antibodies were not cross-linked to protein A beads and give higher background above 30 kd. Exposure time was 2 s.  heled cells. The association of Cipl with cyclin E-Cdk complexes was confirmed using a well-characterized anticyclin E monoclonal antibody (HE1 1; provided by Drs. E. Lees and E. Harlow; data not shown). Cipl Is a Potent Inhibitor of Cdk2 Kinaee Activity Having established in vivo association of Cipl with Cdks, we wished to examine the possible biochemical consequences of this association. Proteins that associate with Cdks could influence the activity or substrate specificity, modify interactions with other proteins, or alter subcellular localization. To examine whether Cipl alters Cdk2 function in vitro, kinase activities were measured in the presence of GST-Cipl using histone Hl as substrate. For  these experiments, essentially homogeneous insect cellderived GST-cyclin A-Cdk2 (6 nM) was used (Figure 5A). GST-Cipl is a potent inhibitor of Cdk2 activity, while GST (400 nM) or GST-Cip2 (400 nM) had no effect (Figure 58). Half-maximal inhibition was observed at -8 nM GSTCipl, suggesting an inhibitor constant (KJ value of -8 nM. However, owing to the concentration of kinase used in these experiments and the probable requirement for 11 stoichiometryof inhibitor binding, it is likelythat significant inhibitor depletion occurred, and, therefore, the true K, value is expected to be significantly lower than 8 nM. Several lines of evidence support a specific inhibitory effect for Cipl as opposed to a nonspecific effect of the GST component or a contaminant in the GST-Cipl prepa Cell  810  96 66.  9666.  3021-  307  4lmm 21 WT.cycun  CST,"M Gsr-cipz, "M GST.CipI,nM .. b ill 4i  AlCdkI  (6 "M, ,,&amp;"p :  lb0  roe  WYI` -Clpl] l==l [PKI]  U IIU 4UU U U SUU U nM ICST-Cipl] U SW nM 5000 0 0 5000 OnM [Csr] mu 0 ntd .._ -..2pM cydin + HI peptide protein kinue + Kemptide A  ration. First, GST-Cipl did not inhibit CAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzed phosphorylation of apeptide substrate at a concentration significantly higher than that required to inhibit CdkP completely (Figure 5C), indicating that Cipl is not a general kinase inhibitor. Second, incubation of phosphorylated histone Hl with 500 nM GST-Cipl did not result in a detectable decrease in the extent of Hl phosphorylation (Figure 5D), indicating the absence of a contaminating phosphatase activity. Third, GST-Cipl also inhibits phosphorylation of an 11 residue histone Hl peptide with essentially the same concentration dependence as the entire Hl protein substrate (Figure 5C), arguing against artifactual steric hindrance with histone Hl as an explanation for inhibition. Finally, Cipl was produced in bacteria both as a polypeptide of native length (164 amino acids) and as a protein fusion with a polyhistidine-T7 gene 70 tag and purified to near homogeneity (Figure 5A). Both of these proteins gave essentially the same inhibition profile as that of GST-Cipl using histone Hl as substrate (Figure 5E), while a mock His-tagged purification from cells lacking Cipl had no effect (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that contaminating bacterial proteins are responsible for inhibition. In experiments described above (see Figure 4C), we found Cipl associated with kinases bound to Ckshs-1 beads. Preincubation with excess Ckshs-1 (1 uM) prior to addition of Cipl (200 nM) had no influence on Cdk2 inhibition (data not shown), consistent with the idea that Ckshs-1 and Cipl binding is not mutually exclusive. To rule out cooperation with trace proteins that copurify with cyclin A-Cdk2 from insect cells, inhibition assays were performed using active cyclin A-CdkP complexes generated from proteins purified to homogeneity from bacteria (ConneWrowley et al., 1993) and, as before, histone Hl phosphorylation was almost completely inhibited by stoichiometric quantities of His-tagged Cipl (data not shown). Having demonstrated that Cipl is a potent inhibitor of recombinant Cdk2, we next examined whether Cipl could  Figure 5.

(C) Cyclin A-Cdk2 (-12 nM) or the catalytic subunit of CAMPdependent protein kinase was mixed with the indicated quantity of GST-Cipl, protein kinase A inhibitor (PKI), or GST protein and kinase assays performed in duplicate using the histone Hl peptide or kemptide (100 PM).

Histone Hl was phosphorylated by cyclin A-CdkP and the reaction quenched by addition of 25 m M EDTA. The indicated amount of GST or GST-Cipl was then added, and histone phosphorylation was quantitated by filter binding after incubation for 15 min at 37%. (E) Histone Hl assays were performed as in (B) except that purified His-tagged Cipl or untagged Cipl (164 residue protein) was used.

HeLa cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against cyclin A, cyclin B, Cdk2, and Cdc2 and the immune complexes used for inhibition assays with Histagged Cipl. We have previously shown that cyclin Acomplexes in these cells contain both Cdc2 and Cdk2, while B-type cyclin complexes contain only Cdc2 (Elledge et al., 1992). The inhibitor concentrations employed (66 and 660 nM) were chosen such that partial (-650/o-90%) and complete (96%) inhibition would be achieved, based on the concentration dependence for inhibition of GST-cyclin ACdk2. The activity of both cyclin A and Cdk2 immune complexes toward histone Hl (Figure 6A) was inhibited to the extent anticipated based on the experiments with cyclin A-CdkP. In contrast, cyclin B and CdcP immune complex kinase activities were inhibited less effectively, consistent with the apparent lower binding efficiency of Cipl for Cdc2 observed in vitro. Cipl Inhibits Rb Phosphorylation by Cyclin-Kinase Complexes Implicated in the Gl-S Transition Hypophosphorylated Rb is thought to exert negative growth control through its association with important cell cycle regulatory molecules such as members of the E2F family of transcription factors (for a review see Nevins, 1992). Phosphorylation of Rb by A-, D-, and E-type cyclinkinases can be detected in vitro (Ewen et al., 1993) and is thought to inactivate the growth inhibitory function of Rb in vivo (Kato et al., 1993; Ewen et al., 1993, and references therein). However, expression patterns and the timing of kinase activation (Koff et al., 1992; Dulic et al., 1992; Matsushime et al., 1992; Rosenblatt et al., 1992) indicate that either E-type or D-type cyclin-kinase complexes are the most likely to inactivate Rb at the Gl-S transition. To determine whether Cipl could inhibit Rb phosphorylation by these Gl cyclin-kinases, we made use of the Rb phosphorylation assay developed by Sherr and coworkers (Matsushime et al., 1992; Kato et al., 1993; Ewen et al., 1993). Insect cells were infected with cyclin- and kinaseexpressing baculoviruses to generate crude extracts containing cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin A-Cdk2, and cyclin D2Cdk4 complexes, and aliquots from these extracts were used in GST-Rb kinase assays. To control for background Rb kinases, extracts were also generated from insect cells infected with single viruses. Like pure cyclin A-Cdk2, the insect cyclin A-Cdk2 complex was effectively inhibited by His-tagged Cipl (Figure 6B). Importantly, E-type and D-type kinase complexes were also completely inhibited by Cipl (Figure 6C). Rb phosphorylation by cyclin DlCdk4 complexes was also completely blocked by Cipl (data not shown). Under the conditions employed in our assays, cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes generated in insect cells are poorer Rb kinases than A-type or E-type kinases, and to achieve quantitatively similar levels of Rb phosphorylation, higher concentrations of cyclin D2-Cdk4 proteins were used in these assays (350-450 nM based on Coomassie staining of hypotonic insect cell lysates derived from cyclin D2Cdk4 coinfection).

After 24 hr. tritiated thymidine was added for a 24 hr period, after which cells were stained for p-galactosidase activity and autoradiographed to determine the percentage of 3-galactosidase-expressing cells in S phase during the labeling period.

A rigorous determination of the relative Ki values for Cipl and various kinase complexes, as well as the mode of inhibition, will require the use of more highly purified kinase complexes. However, the data clearly indicate that Cipl is a potent inhibitor of both D-type and E-type Cdks implicated in the regulation of the Gl to S phase transition as well as A-type cyclin-Cdk2 complexes required for S phase. to reach  Cipl and SV40 T Antigen Act in a Mutually Antagonistic Manner to Regulate Cell Cycle Progression in Human Fibroblasts T antigen is thought to enhance cell cycle progression via its oncogenic functions, while ~21~` is likely to negatively ~' regulate cell cycle progression based on its biochemical activities. ~21~` is found in complexes with multiple Gl ~' cyclin-Cdk complexes in normal human cells, but in cells transformed by SV40 large T antigen, p21C' P1-Cdk associations are greatly diminished or undetectable (Xiong et al., 1993). Thus, T antigen may function to alter or inhibit p21 function. To examine the role of ~21~` in vivo and ~' its relationship with T antigen, a series of experiments were performed to determine the effect of coexpressing T antigen and ~21~"' in human diploid fibroblasts (HCA2) and mouse NIH 3T3 cells. HCAP and NIH 3T3 cells were  transfected with a constant amount of pCMV+GAL and varying amountsof pCMV-CIPl, pCMV-T antigen, or both. [3H]thymidine was added 24 hr posttransfection, and cells were incubated for 24 hr to label nuclei synthesizing DNA during that period. Cells were then stained for P-galactosidase activity to identify cells receiving plasmids and autoradiographed. The percentage of P-galactosidaseexpressing cells that entered S phase during the 24 hr labeling period was determined (Table 2). Cipl expression alone reduces the percentage of cells in S phase in a dose-dependent manner, while low levels of T antigen alone have a slight stimulatory effect on HCA2 cells but not NIH 3T3 cells. In HCA2 cells, over 50% of non-S phase cells (64% reduced to 31%) are stimulated to enter S phase by 2 ng of pCMV-T, suggesting that at least 50% (and probably a much higher percentage of cells) have received pCMV-T. Adding additional pCMV-T has no significant added stimulatory effect on the number of cell in S phase, suggesting that the effect is saturated at low pCMV-T levels in the absence of extra Cipl. Cipl and high levels of T antigen expressed together display mutually antagonistic properties. For example, in HCA2 cells at 11 ng of pCMV-CIPl , the S phase population is diminished 66% (from 36% to 4.3%; Table 2, column 1). This indicates that a large percentage of cells expressing f3-galactosidase also received pCMV-CIPl Low levels of T antigen have no effect on the ability of p21 to alter the number of cells entering S phase. However, in the presence of 20 ng of pCMV-T, the percentage of S phase cells is increased from 4.3% to 290/o, an increase of 25% of the total transfected population. If 86% of the transfected population has received pCMV-CIPl , then T antigen must be activating S phase in some cells that were expressing levels of Cipl sufficient to inhibit S phase entry under normal conditions. Conversely, Cipl acts tocounterthestimulatory effects of T antigen expression but less efficiently at high pCMV-T concentrations (compare the 2 ng and 20 ng columns for human fibroblasts in Table 2). Experiments using NIH 3T3 cells also demonstrate an antagonistic relationship between Cipl and T antigen. Transfection of 0.15 pg of pCMV-CIPl alone reduces S phase cells from 76% to 150/o, indicating that 80% of the cells received pCMVCIP1. Cotransfection with an additional 1.5 pg of pCMV-T almost completely reverses this (increasing from 15% to 490/o, an increase of 34% of the total transfected population). In the NIH 3T3 cell experiment, it is mathematically impossible for T antigen to pro duce  its stimulatory effect without overcoming at least some cells that were expressing levels of Cipl sufficient to inhibit S phase entry under normal conditions. In these experiments, cotransfection with pCMV-T showed no effect on expression from the CMV promoter (data not shown). The fact that T antigen can overcome inhibition by Cipl in both HCA2 cells and NIH 3T3 cells indicates that Cipl is preventing S phase by arresting, not killing, cells. The fact that two different cell types transfected by two different methods yielded similar results indicates that these results are not peculiar to the cells or methods used. These data indicate that Cipl and T antigen play mutually antagonistic roles in the control of cell cycle progression and may function in the same pathway.  Cipl Is an Inhibitor of Gi Cyclin-Dependent 813  Kinases  Discussion Although it is clear that Gi cyclin-Cdk complexes are important for the control of cell proliferation, surprisingly little is known about the mechanism(s) through which the activities of these complexes are regulated. We have employed a genetic approach to identify genes encoding proteins that physically associate with Cdks. Using a modified version of the two-hybrid system, we identified two genes, C/P7 and CIP2, that encode proteins that physically associate with Cdks in vitro. This work has focused on the function of CIP7, which encodes a 164 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 18 kd that migrates as 21 kd on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Cipl can bind several Cdks as in vitro translation products, most notably Cdk2, Cdk3, and CdcP. C/P7 encodes the protein referred to as p21 by Xiong et al. (1992, 1993) based on V8 proteolytic cleavage patterns. In human diploid fibroblasts, p21 is found associated with multiple cyclin-Cdk complexes, including complexes involving cyclins A, 6, D, E, Cdk2, Cdk4, CdkS, and Cdc2 (Figure 4) (Xiong et al., 1993). C/P7 defines a novel class of protein kinase inhibitors that is specific for members of the Cdk family. It is capable of inhibiting the activity of a variety of cyclin-Cdk complexes produced as purified proteins from bacteria, as immunoprecipitates from mammalian cells, or in crude lysates from insect cells. These include Cdk2 complexed with cyclins A and E, Cdd complexed with cyclins A and B, and Cdk4 complexed with cyclins Dl and D2. Furthermore, Cipl inhibits kinase activity toward all substrates tested, including histone Hl , a related peptide, and a putative physiological substrate, Rb. That Cipl does not require the presence of additional cellular proteins to perform its inhibitory function was demonstrated by its ability to inhibit a homogeneous bacterially produced cyclin A-Cdk2 complex with an apparent stoichiometry similar to that observed for inhibition of complexes produced in eukaryotic cells. This experiment indicates that the mechanism by which the inhibition occurs is unlikely to be removal of (or interference with) the phosphate on Thr-160 because the bacterially produced cyclin A-CdkP complex lacks that activating phosphate and is still inhibited. The finding that Cipl is contained in cyclin immune complexes demonstrates that the mechanism of inhibition is unlikely to involve disruption of the cyclin-Cdk complex. Inhibition most likely involves the formation of a ternary complex containing Cdk, Cipl, and cyclin. We have not observed phosphorylation of Cipl by CdkP, but it is possible that phosphorylation of Cipl by other kinases could regulate its function. Furthermore, Cipl bears no sequence relationship to the known negative regulators of cell proliferation in yeast, Far1 (Chang and Herskowitz, 1990) and ~40~` (Mendenhall, 1993; M. D. Mendenhall, personal ~' communication), and may be unique to mammals. Recent experiments utilizing transfection of dominant negative versions of Cdks (E. Harlow and S. van der Heuvel, personal communication; Harlow and van der Heuvel, submitted) have implicated essential and distinct roles for Cdk2 and Cdk3 in the Gl to S phase transition in mammaIran cells, but not other Cdks and related proteins currently known (Meyerson et al., 1992). Both Cdk2 and Cdk3 are  targets of Cipl binding, but Cdk3 kinase activity has not yet been detected, thus preventing the direct assessment of Cipl inhibition. However, based on the strong in vitro binding data (Figure 36) and the structural similarities of Cdk3 to the other kinases inhibited by Cipl, it is likely that Cipl will also inhibit Cdk3 and other Cdk complexes with which it associates. Thus, Cipl is potentially capable of inhibiting all currently known Cdks with a demonstrated role in the Gl-S phase transition. This places Cipl in a position to play an important regulatory role in control of cell proliferation. We have presented strong in vitro evidence for an inhibitory role of Cipl in Cdk function, suggesting that Cipl will play a negative role in cell proliferation in vivo. What role might Cipl play in human cells? The fact that Cipl is found associated with Cdks in growing cells suggests that it could help regulate normal cell cycle transitions. For example, Cipl could serve to dampen kinase activity during cyclin accumulation until a point when excess cyclin-kinase complexes are produced, thereby acting as an internal timing mechanism coordinating cell cycle transitions, checkpoint controls, or both. In addition, external growth control signals such as serum deprivation, contact inhibition, or growth factor inhibition or stimulation could function through Cipl to modulate Cdk-mediated phosphorylation of Rb and other essential substrates, thereby controlling passage through the restriction point. Activation or synthesis of a kinase inhibitor has been postulated as a possible mechanism of TGF9 action (Koff et al., 1993). ~21~` or a related protein could be responsible ~' for cell cycle arrest by any of these stimuli. Furthermore, loss of Cipl function, either by mutation or by altered expression, might contribute to cell proliferation in the presence of negative growth signals, in much the same way that far7 mutants continue cycling in the presence of a factor. A molecule with such properties would be a candidate for a novel tumor suppressor gene. Cipl is associated with multiple Cdks in normal diploid fibroblasts, but not in cells transformed by SV40 T antigen (Xiong et al., 1993). We have observed that increased expression of C/P7 results in a large reduction in the number of cells in S phase. This inhibition is largely reversed by coexpression of T antigen, with the largest effect observed at lower C/P7 levels. This is consistent with a model whereby Cipl plays an inhibitory role in cell cycle progression that is circumvented by the action of T antigen. T antigen functions by binding Rb and ~53 and by blocking their ability to negatively regulate cell cycle progression. In a screen to identify cDNAs induced by ~53, El-Deiry et al. (1993 [this issue of Cc/I)) identified a gene, WAF7, encoding the major p53inducible transcript in mammalian cells. WAf7 is identical to CIP7. The ability of T antigen to overcome C/P7 function in cotransfection experiments may be mediated in part by interfering with ~53 activation of endogenous C/P7 expression. However, because the additional C/P7 is expressed from a CMV promoter, T antigen may also affect C/P7 function posttranscriptionally, a possibility that remains to be explored. Together these discoveries establish a direct link between an oncogene, a tumor suppressor gene, and negative regulation of the basic cell cycle regulatory machinery  and provide a plausible explanation for the role of p53 in control of cell proliferation and cancer. Inactivation of p53 reduces C/f 7 expression, directly increasing Gl cyclinCdk activity toward Rb and other substrates necessary for cell proliferation. It is likely that C/f 7 also mediates growth control signals from pathways independent of ~53. Regulation of Cdks through inhibitors such as C/P7 may represent a general strategy employed to control cell proliferation in response to external signals and developmental programs. Experimental Procedures  ing !3-galactosidase were scored for labeling, and each point is the average of four separate wells. Production of Cyclins and Kinases in Insect Cells Baculoviruses expressing GST-cyclin A and CdkP were provided by H. Piwnica-Worms, D-type cyclins and Cdk4 by C. Sherr, and cyclin E by D. Morgan. For preparations of insect cell lysates, Sf9 cells (- 2 x 108) were infected with the indicated viruses. After 40 hr, cells were lysed in 170 pl of 50 m M HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 m M MgC&amp;, and 10 m M dithiothreitol (DlT) containing 0.5 m M NaF, 0.1 m M sodium vanadate, 5 pglml leupeptin, 5 pglml antipain, 0.5 m M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Matsushime et al., 1992). Cleared lysates were stored at -7OOC. Cyclin and kinase expression was verified by either immunoblotting or by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. For purification of activated cyclin A-CdkP, 200 ml of Sf9 cells (1 x 1 OBper milliliter) were coinfected with GST-cyclin A and CdkP viruses. After 40 hr, cells were lysed in 5 ml of 20 m M Tris-HCI (pH 8), 2 m M EDTA, 100 m M NaCI, 5 m M NaF, 30 m M p-nitrophenylphosphate, 1 m M sodium vanadate, IO @g/ml leupeptin, IO pglml antipain, 1 m M PMSF containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and cleared by centrifugation. Extractswere diluted 4-fold with 20 m M HEPES (pH 7.5), 15 m M MgQ, 5 m M EGTA, 1 m M DlT, 1 m M ATP, and proteaselphosphatase inhibitors as above and incubated with 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) for 60 min. The resin was washed three times with lysis buffer, and GST-cyclin A-CdkP was eluted with 0.5 ml of 50 m M Tris-HCI (pH 8.0) containing 20 m M glutathione, 120 m M NaCI, 5 pglml leupeptin, 5 pglml antipain, 0.5 m M NaF. 0.1 m M sodum vanadate, 1 m M EDTA. Complexes (6 PM) were stored at -7OOC. Recombinant Proteins Ckshs-1 was immobilized using Affigel-10 at 5 pg/ml. pGST-CIPl and pRSET-CIPl were constructed by ligating a 1 kb Xhol-EcoRI fragment from PACT-CIPl (clone 7) into pGEX-PTKcs (J. W. H., unpublished data) or pRSET-B (Invitrogen). Met-l of Cipl is linked to GST through a 36 amino acid linker sequence (SHMPMARGHEGPEVSSLWSRSWARIRRGTEALRGGA). pRSET-CIPl expresses Cipl containing an N-terminal 71 residue His-tagged-T7 gene 10 fusion, producing a 29 kd protein. For expression of native Cipl (164 residues), the open reading frame was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers that incorporate 5' Ndel and 3' BamHl sites, confirmed by sequencing, and cloned into pET3b. GST fusions were prepared as described (ConnellCrowely et al., 1993). His-tagged and native Cipl were produced in strain BL21(DE3) and purified from inclusion bodies and, after refolding from 5 M guanidinium-HCI, 50 m M Tris-HCI (pH 8), and 5 m M EDTA, diluted into 50 ml of 50 m M Tris-HCI (pH 8), 1 m M DTT, 20% glycerol, 5 wglml leupeptin, 5 pg/ml antipain, 0.5 m M PMSF. The solution was stirred for 2 hr, cleared, and stored at 10 K M (-70°C). For Cipl, the refolded protein was dialyzed against 20 m M Tris-HCI (pH 8) containing 25 m M NaCI, 2 m M EDTA, 2 m M DlT, and 0.5 m M PMSF and then chromatographed on TSK-DEAE and Econo-pak S columns using NaCl gradients for elution. In Vitro Binding For in vitro binding, 12 ~1 of reticulocyte translate was added to 150 wlofbinding buffer(50mMTris-HCI. 120mM NaCI,2mM EDTA,O.l% Nonidet P-40, 1 m M NaF, 0.1 sodium vanadate, 5 pglml leupeptin, 5 pglml antipain, 5 pglml aprotinin) containing 8 pl of affinity matrices and rotated for 30 min at 4°C. Matrices were washed three times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer prior to electrophoresis and autoradiography (16-24 hr). The densities of proteins on beads were as follows: Ckshs-1, 5 pglpl; GST-Cipl, 0.4 uglpl; GST, 2 pg/Kl. Kinase Assays Histone Hl kinase assays of purified GST-cyclin A-Cdk2 were performed in 25 pl of 65 m M K-p-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 15 m M MgCl?, 16 m M EGTA, 10 m M DTT, 1 mglml ovalbumin, 0.5 m M NaF, 0.1 m M sodium otthovanadate, 5 pglml leupeptin, and [Y-~` P]ATP (0.01-0.3 nCi/pmol) with other added components as indicated. Assays contained 2.5 V M histone Hl and 3-12 nM GST-cyclin A-Cdk2 complex. After 15 min at 37OC, 10 VI aliquots were removed and spotted on phosphocellulose paper for quantitation, and the remainder was mixed with 15 ~1 of 2 x SDS buffer prior to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.  Expression Plasmids Plasmids for translation of CdkP, cyclin A, and CdcP have been described (Elledge et al., 1992). p40uo15 was obtained via polymerase chain reaction amplification using a Xenopus egg cDNA library. pAS2 was obtained by introducing a 1.5 kb BamHI-Sacl fragment containing CyH2 into Bglll-Sacl-cleaved pAS1 (Durfee et al., 1993). pAS2-CDK2 and pAS2-CDC2 were generated by ligating the coding region for CDK2 and CDC2 (as Ndel-BamHI fragments) into pAS2. pCMV-CIPl was constructed by ligating a Spel-linked 684 bp fragment containing C/PI into pCMV-P-GAL (Clonetech), replacing /acZ. pCMV-T was a gift of J. Campesi. Antlbodles Affinity-purified antibodies against CdkP, cyclin A, and CdcP (Elledge et al., 1992) were cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose as described (Harlow and Lane, 1966). Antisera against cyclin B was provided by Dr. H. Piwnica-Worms. Antibodies against cyclin Dl and cyclin E were provided by Drs. E. Lees, E. Harlow, and F. Hall. Antibodies against His-tagged Cipl were prepared in rabbits and were depleted with Escherichiacoli proteins prior to affinity purification using gel-purified GSTCipl immobilized on nitrocellulose. Yeast Strains Y190 was constructed by plating Y153 (Durfee et al., 1993) on YPD containing IO mglml cycloheximide medium and by selecting for cycloheximide resistance. Y190 is (MATa, leu2-$7 12, ura3-52, trpl-901, his3-A200, ade2-101, gal4AgalBOA MA3 GAL-IacZ, LYS GAL-HISS, cyh' Y167 (MATa gal4 gal80 his3 trpl-901 ). ade2-101 ura3-52 /eo2-3,-712 UfiA3 GAL-/acZ mef) was made by crossing Y153 and GGY171 (Fields and Song, 1969). Library Transformations Y190 containing pAS2CDK2 was transformed and selected as previouslydescribed (Durfee et al., 1993). Loss of the pAS2CDK2 plasmid was selected by streaking on SC lacking leucine, 2.5 mglml cycloheximide medium and plasmid loss verified by replica plating onto SC lacking tryptophan and leucine. The resulting strains were mated with Y167 strains containing pAS1 derivatives expressing Gal4(1-147) fusion proteins unrelated to CdkP (Table 1) by selection on SC medium lacking tryptophan and leucine and tested for l3-galactosidase. Clones specific for CdkP or both Cdk2 and CdcP were considered positive and recovered into E. coli. Cell Culture, Transfectlons, and Northern Analysis Human diploid fibroblasts (a gift from Dr. J. Smith, passages 17-20) were grown in Dulbecco' minimal essential medium containing 10% s fetal calf serum at 37OC. ["Slmethionine labeling was performed using cells at 50%-70% confluence (Xiong et al., 1993). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by the BES-calcium phosphate procedure (Chen and Okayama, 1967) while HCAP human diploid fibroblast were transfected by DEAE-dextran (Cullen, 1987). Cells were plated 7 x l(r per well 1 day prior to transfection. Transfections contained a constant amount of pCMV+GALandvaryingamountsofpCMV-CIPI, pCMV-T, orboth, using pCMV as carrier to provide equal amounts of transfected DNA (Table 2). The media was changed 20 hr posttransfection and 4 hr later made 1 bCi/ml with [3H]thymidine. Labeling was for 24 hr, and then cells were stained for b-galactosidase activity, followed by processing for autoradiography. For each assay point, 100 nuclei express Cipl  Is an Inhibitor of Gl Cyclin-Dependent 815  Kinases  For peptide assays, cyclin A-Cdk2 was incubated with 50 KM histone Hl peptide (AKAKKTPKKAK), and 15 ul was spotted on phosphocellulose filter paper for quantitation. Filters were washed in IO m M phosphoric acid prior to scintillation counting. For assay of bacterial cyclin A-CdkP, - 100 nM hemagglutinin (HA)-Cdk2 was incubated with 300 nM cyclin A in 25 ul (Connell-Crowley et al., 1993). For immunoprecipitation kinase assays, HeLa cell SlOO extracts (1 mg of protein) were incubated with anti-Cdk2, anti-Cdc2, anti-cyclin A, anti-cyclin B, or anti-HA antibodies in binding buffer, and complexes were collected with 25 ~1 of protein A-Sepharose. Beads were washed three times with binding buffer, washed once with 50 m M Tris-HCI, 15 m M MgCI,, 1 m M DTT, and aliquoted into three portions of 20 VI each for assays. In Vivo Association [=S]methionine-labeled or unlabeled human fibroblasts at 50%-70% confluence were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of binding buffer (containing 0.1% and 0.4% Nonidet P40for labeled and unlabeled cells, respectively), and insoluble material was removed bycentrifugation. Extracts were precleared with antiHA antibodies on protein A and immunoprecipited. Anti-cyclin A, antiCdk2, and preimmune sera were covalently linked to protein A (Harlow and Lane, 1988). For cyclin Di and cyclin E immunoprecipitations, IO ~1 of immunoglobulin G in conjunction with 20 ~1 of protein A-Sepharose was used. Immune complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer as above, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and processed for autoradiography or immunoblotting. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Staphylococcus aureus V8 prote,ase peptide mapping was performed as described (Harlow and Lane, 1988) using 17.5% SDS-PAGE. .Acknowledgments ` thank Drs. D. Morgan and C. Sherr for baculoviruses, L.

											<Abstract>cDNA clones encoding a human IL-10R (hIL-10R) from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, express a 90 to 110 kDa polypeptide in COS7 cells that binds hIL-10 specifically. The predicted amino acid sequence of hIL-10R is 60% identical and 73% similar to mouse IL-10R (mIL-10R). rIL-10R expressed in an IL-3-dependent mouse pro-B cell line (Ba/F3) binds hIL-10 with high affinity (200 to 250 pM), and the transfected cells exhibit a proliferative response to hIL-10. Mouse IL-10 does not bind to hIL-10R, and hIL-10R-expressing Ba/F3 cells do not respond to the mouse cytokine, observations consistent with the known species specificity of IL-10. Expression of hIL-10R mRNA seems to be restricted mainly to human hemopoietic cells and cell lines. In a number of human T cell clones, expression of hIL-10R mRNA is down-regulated after activation of the cells with anti-CD3 Ab and phorbol ester. The hIL-10R gene is on human chromosome 11. Like mIL-10R, hIL-10R is structurally related to IFNR. Because IL-10 inhibits macrophage activation by IFN-gamma, this relationship suggests possible shared receptor or signal transduction pathway components.</Abstract>

Downloaded from www.jimmunol.org on November 6, 2009  L-10 is a cytokine produced B cells, T by helper cells, monocytes/macrophages, and keratinocytes (1-3). Human and mouse IL-IO (hIL-10, mIL-10)3 inhibit cytokine synthesis by activated T cells (4-6), NK cells (7), and monocytes/macrophages (8-1 1). In addition to this inhibitory activity,IL-10costimulates proliferation and differentiation of human B cells (12), mouse thymocytes, mouse T cells (13-15) and mast cells (16), up-regulates class I1 MHC expression on mouse B cells (17), and sustains viability of mouse mast cell lines and mouse B cells in vitro (17, 18). Unlike hIL-10, mIL-10 is speciesspecific and is only active on mouse cells (1, 19). At least two herpesviruses,EBVandequineherpesvirustype2, encode viral homologues of IL-10 (18, 20, 21).

The different activities of IL-10 are likely mediated by IL-1ORs expressed at the cell surface. We have reported recently the identification and cloning of mIL-1OR (24). Here we describe isolation and functional expression of hIL-1OR cDNA clones from a human Burkitt lymphoma cellline. The rhIL-1OR cDNA has 70% DNA sequence homology (5"untranslated region and predicted proteincoding region)to mIL- 1OR, with 60% identity between the predicted amino acid sequences.Although mIL-1OR binds both the mouse andhuman cytokines (24), hIL-1OR is species-specific, bindingonlyhIL-10.Like mIL-IOR, hIL10R is structurally related to IFNR, and thus is a new member of the class I1 (IFNR-like) subgroup of the cytokine receptor family.

Cell lines and Abs BJAB cells were provided by Dr. J. Banchereau (Schering-Plough; Dardilly, France)and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS(R10 medium). B e 3 cells were provided by Dr. T. Kitamura (DNAX) and maintained in R10 + 50 p M P-mercaptoethanol and 10 ng/ml mIL-3 (BaF medium). U937 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in R10 with or without 1.5% DMSO. DMSO induces differentiation of U937 cells to cells with properties characteristic of mature macrophages (25, 26). RPMI 8866 cells and Daudi (Burkitt lymphoma) cells were as described (27) and were all maintained in R10 + 50 pM P-mercaptoethanol. COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS. Transfection of COS7 and BafF3 cells were performed as described (24,28). Anti-hIL-I0 (12G8) and its isotype control (GLl17) mAb were provided by Dr. J. Abrams and Mr. J. Silver (DNAX). The 12G8 mAbalso reacts with mIL-10 (K. W. Moore, unpublished observation). Anti-FLAG mAb M1 and M2 were purchased from IBI-Kodak (Rochester, NY). SA-PE and mAb used in magnetic-bead depletion experiments were purchased from Becton Dickinson (Mountain View, CA).  Detection of hlL- 1OR FACS. Human cells and cell lines were incubated with 30 to 60 nM FLAG-hIL-10 in FACS buffer (HBSS supplemented with 3% FCS, 0.02% NaN,) on ice for 1 h. After staining, cells were pelleted and resuspended directly in cross-linking solution (Dulbecco's phosphatebuffered saline/50 mM HEPES pH 8.3/0.2 mM BS3 (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL)) for 30 minon ice. Excess BS3 was quenched by adding Tris-HCI pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 50 mM. Cells were then washed twice in FACS buffer, incubated with 10 pg/ml biotinylated M 1 mAb for 30 min on ice,then washed and incubated with SA-PE prior to FACS analysis as described (24). To determine specificity of binding, COS7 or B e 3 cells expressing rhIL-10R were incubated with 5 nM FLAG-hIL-10 in the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of the competing cytokine, then subjected to further treatment and FACS analysis as above. Ligand binding. Transfected BafF3 cells expressing rhIL-10R (see below) were incubated as triplicate samples ( IO6 cells/sample) with 4-530 pM 12sI-labeledhIL-10 in the presence or absence of 150 nM hlL-IO for 4hat 4°Cin RPMI 1640. 2% BSA,0.02% sodium azide, and then pelleted through a mixture of phthalate oils as described (24, 33, 34). The cell pellet and supernatant were assessed for bound and free '*'I cpm, respectively. Nonspecific binding cpm in samples containing unlabeled hIL-IO competitor were subtracted to obtain specific binding cpm. Values for Kd and receptor number were obtained by Scatchard analysis (24, 33, 34). SDS-PAGE. The detailed procedure was described previously (24). Briefly, hIL-IOR expressed by BJAB cells and hIL-10R cDNA-transfected COS7 cells was bound to 3sS-methionine-labeled FLAG-hIL-10 and cross-linked with sulfo-EGS (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL), followed by lysis in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Cleared lysates or anti-FLAG mAb M2 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.  Purification o human cells for RNA isolation f Human PBMC were isolated from buffy coats from healthy donors by centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) (7). PBMC were incubated in cell culture dishes for 40 to 60 min at 37°C. Non-adherent cells were washed away, and the adherent cells were directly lysed on the plates with guanidinium thiocyanate for RNA preparation as described previously ( I 8,20). Human monocytedrnacrophages of 80 to 90% purity were isolated by adherence to gelatin-coated plates as described (7, 29). T cells and LGL cells were isolated from PBMC after adherence, passage over a nylon wool column, density centrifugation on a percoll gradient, and negative selection by magnetic beads. Briefly, PBMC were incubated at IO8 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) for 45 min at 37°C. Nonadherent cells were removed and passed over a nylon wool column (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 30% percoll, loaded on a 40% percoll gradient, and centrifuged for 25 min at 1400 X g. The pellet consisted of small resting T cells, which were &amp;gt;98% CD2', CD3'. The interphase, containing LGL, was incubated with saturating concentrations of antiLCD14 (Leu-M3),anti-CD3 (Leu-4), anti-CD4(Leu-3a), anti-CD19 (Leu-12), and anti-CD20 (Leul6) mAb for 30 min at 4°C. washed, and incubated with sheep anti-mouse IgG-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M450, Dynal A. S . , Oslo, Norway) at a bead to cell ratio of 20: I . The mixture was incubated with gentle shaking for 30 min at 4°C. and rosetted cells were removed with the magnetic particle concentrator according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The resulting population was 80 to 90% CD16+, CD56'. B cells were isolated from mononuclear cells obtained from spleens of healthy donors by centrifugation through Ficoll-Hypaque. Mononuclear cells were incubated with saturating concentrations of anti-CD2 (Leu5b), antiLCD3 (Leu-4), anti-CD4 (Leu-3a), anti-CDR (Leu-2a), antiCD14 (Leu-M3), antiLCD16 (Leu-I la), and anti-CD56 (Leu-19) mAb for 30 min at 4°C and subjected to negative selection with magnetic beads as described above. The resulting population was &amp;gt;95% CD19+, CD20'.  Downloaded from www.jimmunol.org on November 6, 2009  cDNA library construction A BJAB cDNA library of approximately IO7 independent clones was prepared using the Super Script Plasmid System (BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), except that BstXI adaptors instead of Sun adaptors were used. Double-stranded cDNA was size-selected on Chromaspin-1000 columns (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), ligated into the expression vector pJFE14 (35). and transformed into Escherichia coli DHlOB cells.  Expression cloning o hlL- 1OR cDNA f Screening of the BJAB cDNA library was performed by several rounds of transfection and selection by panning (24, 36-38). In the first round, 4.5 X lo7 COS7 cells were transfected with the BJAB cDNA library by electroporation. Three daysafter transfection, COS7 cells were harvested from the plates with 0.5 mM EDTA/0.02% NaN, and incubated with 30 to 60 nM FLAG-hIL-I0 for 1 h on ice, followed by cross-linking with BS3. COS7 cells expressing hIL-10R were then selected on plates coated with anti-FLAG mAbs MI and M2. Plasmid DNA recovered from the selected cells was transformed into E. coli DH IOB cells by electroporation and reintroduced into COS7 cells by spheroplast fusion for subsequent rounds of panning. After three cycles of panning, DNAs were prepared from randomly picked E. coli and digested with XhoI and Nor1 to release cDNA inserts. Approximately one-third of the clones analyzed had the same 3.6 kb insert, and two ofthem (pYLB5, pYLB6) were chosen for analysis by expression in COS7 cells. An XbaI/PvuII DNA fragment from the 5'-end of pYLB5 was used as a probe to isolate another clone (pSW8.1) from the original BJAB cDNA library. The DNAsequence of hIL- 10R was determined by using pSW8.1 subclones as templates as described (18) and analyzed using software from Intelligenetics, Inc. (Mountain View, CA).  Structure and expression of FLAG-hlL- 7 0 A 21 amino acid signal sequence and 8 amino acid FLAG peptide sequence (30) were fused to the hIL-IO coding region at the N-terminus by PCR as described previously (24,3 I): MALPVTALLLPLALLLHAARP (signal peptide sequence)-DYKDDDDK (FLAG)-SPGQGTQSENS . . . (hIL-IO). The PCR product was cloned in the pcDSRa296 vector (32). Transient expression of FLAG-hIL-10 in COS7 cells was analyzed by 3sS-methionine-labeling/SDS-PAGE and (20), by ELlSA with antiFLAG mAb M1 as the coating mAb and anti-hIL-IO as the detecting mAb (10, 24). The expression level of FLAG-hIL-10 was the same as hIL-10, and its biological activities were indistinguishable from hIL-IO as assessed in the CSIF assay (4, 5) and by costimulation of proliferation of mouse MC/9 mast cells in the presence of IL-4 (1 6, 18). Furthermore,  Analysis o hlL-10R mRNA expression f hIL-1OR mRNA expression in various human tissues was tested by probing human multiple-tissue Northern blots (Clontech, Palo-Alto, CA) with  Journal of Immunology  1823  FIGURE 1.

Expression of hIL-IOR mRNA in human cells/ cell lines was detected byRNAblot hybridization as described (18). Filters were probed tirst with hlL-IOR and subsequently with human p-actin (Clontech. Palo Alto, CA). hlL-IOR RNA blots required 24 to 72 h exposure times; p-actin required 2 to 3 h.Quantitative measurements of hIL-IOR hybridization signals were made on a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics. Sunnyvale. CA) with reference to the p-actin hybridization signal as a standard. After subtraction of background from the hIL-IOR and P-actin signals. the ratio of their intensities was calculated for each sample for purposes of comparison.  Results Detection of hlL-1 OR on BJAB cells  Expression of hlL-10R in transfected B d F 3 cells The hlL-IOR cDNA pSW8.1 was transfected into BaF3 cells along with a plasmid encoding neomycin resistance as described (24, 28). G418resistant hIL-IOR-expressing cells (Bag.I ) were twice sorted for hlL-IOR expression and expanded in culture (24). Ba/F3 and Ba8.1 cells were tested for binding to various concentrations of FLAG-hIL-IO and analyzed by FACS (24). Their responsiveness to hIL-IO and mIL-IO was tested as follows (24): 2000 to 5 0 0 0 cells were cultured with various amounts of IL-IO in a total volume of 1 0 0 *I in 96-well culture plates for 48 h at 37°C. A IO p aliquot of Alamar Blue dye solution (Alamar I Biosciences, Sacramento. CA) was added to each well. After IO to 14 h incubation, the response was determined by measuring As70-ANX).  hIL- 10-responsive cells, which included human adherent cells from PBMC from healthy human donors (7) and human cell lines, were tested for their ability to bind FLAGhIL-IO. A Burkitt lymphoma cell line, BJAB, was found to give reproducible but low levels of specific FLAG-hIL- I O binding that were reduced to background by excess hIL-IO as competitor (Fig. IA). The level of this specific staining increased when BJAB cells were transferred to fresh culture medium and maintained at low cell density 14 to 16 h before analysis, probably because production of low but detectable amounts of hIL-IO by BJAB cells themselves leads to substantial occupancy of hIL- 10R by endogenous hIL-IO. This observation suggested that only unoccupied hIL-IOR could be readilydetected by FLAG-hIL-IO, or alternatively that hIL- 1 OR may undergo ligand-induced down-modulation on BJAB cells. Expression of hlL- 1OR clones  Chromosomal localization of the hlL- 1OR gene The chromosomal location of the hIL-IOR gene was determined by hybridization to Mspl digests of genomic DNA from a panel of human-hamstersomaticcellhybrids on a filter purchased from BIOS Corporation (New Haven, CT). The full-length hIL-IOR cDNA was used as a probe.  COS7 cellstransfected with candidate hIL-IOR cDNA clones (Materials and Methods) were assessed for ability to bind FLAG-hIL-IO. Figure 1B shows specific staining of COS7 cellsexpressing the pYLB5 clone, which was reduced to background in the presence of excess hIL-10 (Fig. IB) but not mIL-IO (data not shown).

The prominent bands near the 49 kDa standard are cross-linked FLAG-hlL-10 and FLAG-mlL-10 homodimers, as noted earlier (24).  microscopy of pYLB5-transfected COS7 cells also showed specific staining with FLAG-hIL-IO that was not inhibited by excess mIL-IO (Fig. IC, 0, E ) . In contrast to BJAB cells, use of the cross-linking reagent was not required for detection of hIL-IOR expressed on COS7 cells, probably because of increased avidity for ligand due to higher hIL- 10R density. hIL-IOR was visualized as a 120 to 140 kDa protein by cross-linking "S-labeled FLAG-hIL-IO bound to hIL-IOR expressed on both BJAB and hIL-IOR cDNA-transfected COS7 cells (Fig. 2). This protein is the same size as mILIOR detected on mIL-IOR-transfected COS7 cells (24). No such protein species was detected in mock-transfected COS7 cells (not shown). Subtracting the mass of one (-20 kDa) or two (-40 kDa) FLAG-hIL- I O peptide chains gave the estimated size of hIL-IOR as 90 to 1 I O kDa. Sequence analysisof hlL- 7 OR cDNA  quence is -61 kDa, in contrast to the observed size of 90 to 1 10 kDa (Fig. 2). This suggested that, likemIL-IOR (24), and as observed with other CRs (40), hIL-IOR may sites be glycosylated at one or more of the six potential identified in the extracellular domain (Fig. 3). The nucleotide sequence of pSW8.1 is 70% homologous to the mIL10R cDNA in the 5"untranslated and predicted proteincoding regions. The predicted amino acid sequences of hIL-IORandmIL-IOR are 60% identical; if chemically similar amino acids are included, the homology (similarity) is -73% (Fig. 3). IL- I O was predicted to be a member of the four a-helix bundle cytokine family (41), and most receptors for these cytokines (for example, IL-2, -3, -4, -5, -6, and IL-7; GCSF; GM-CSF) are in the class I group of the CR superfamily (42). However, like mIL-IOR, the structure of hIL10R is more similar to the smaller group of class I1 CRs that includes IFNR, a viral IFNR homolog, and tissue factor (42-44). The extracellular portion of hIL-IOR may be considered as two homologous segments of 1 I O amino acids that are similar to the size of the immunoglobulinlike ligand-binding domains of the growth hormone receptor (42, 45). The first class I1 CR domain features two conserved tryptophans and the second cysteine pairof class I CRs; however hIL-I OR, unlike mIL-1OR, lacks this cysteine pair (Fig. 3).  Downloaded from www.jimmunol.org on November 6, 2009   Functional  expression of hlL- 7 OR in BdF3 cells  To avoid possible mutations of cDNAs due to serial passages in COS7 cells during cDNA library screening, a fragment from the 5'-end of pYLB5 was used as a hybridization probeto isolate another clone from the original BJAB cDNA library (pSW8.1), which was then used for DNA sequence analysis. The DNA sequence3 contained an open reading frame encoding a protein of 578 amino acids, including a putative signal peptide sequence of 21 amino acids (39), a 215 amino acid extracellular domain, a transmembrane segment of 25 amino acids, and a cytoplasmic domain of 3 17 amino acids. The calculated molecular mass of hIL-l O from the deduced amino acid seR 'Thesequence reported in this paper has been deposited in the Cenbank database, Accession No. lJ00672.  The hIL- I OR cDNA pSW8.1 was transfected along with a plasmid encoding a neomycin resistance gene into a mouse pro-B cell line, BaF3, which expresses little or no mIL- 10R (24). (3418-resistant cells expressing rhIL- 10R (Ba8.1) were isolated by FACS (Fig. 4A, B), expanded in culture, and tested for ability to bind '2sI-labeled hIL- I O (Scatchard analysis, Fig. 4 0 and respond to either hIL-IO or mIL-IO (proliferation assay; Fig. 40). The negative control Neor plasmid-transfected BaF3 cell line (BaFNeo) neither binds hIL-IO (Fig. 4B), nor responds to hIL-IO in the proliferation assay (Fig. 40). Ba8.1 cells expressed about 7000 receptors per cell and bound '2sI-labeled hIL-IO with a Kd of 200 to 250 pM (Fig. 4 0 . This is similar to the Kd of 50 to 200 pMof hIL-IOR reported by Tan et al., for the human JY cell line (46), and somewhat higher than -70 pM reported for rmIL-1OR (24). This value reflects a relatively high affinity compared with other CRs (47), whichhave Kd values ranging from 30 pM for the high-affinity erythropoietin receptor to 120 nM for the low-affinity hIL-3R. Neither BaF-Neo nor parental BaF3 cells gave a proliferative response to hIL-IO or mIL-IO, but Ba8.1 cells, like BaF3 transfectants expressing mIL-IOR (24), responded to hIL- I O in an assay measuring proliferation and viability (Fig. 40). The response was inhibited by a neutralizing anti-hIL-IO mAb (Fig. 4 0 ) and thus was specific  lournal of Immunology  1825  MLPCLWLLAALLSLRLGSDAHGTELPSEPS-YWTEAEFFHHLLHPI@E$STCYE 11 I I II I I IIIIIII I I I I I I II IIIII IIIIIIIII 11 MLSRLLPFLVTISS.LSLEFIAYGTELPSP-SYYW~EARFFQH~~PI~STYYE VALLRYGIES-~SI~~~TLSYDLTAVTLDLYH-SNGYBARVRAVDGSRH~ Ill 11 I II I 1 I I 1 I l l IIIIII I IIIIIIIIII I Ill1 VALKQY~DIHI~RKAQALSGDLTTFTLDLYHRS  v  A  TNTRFSVDEVTLTVGSVNLEIHNGFILGK~QLPRPKMAP~ESIFSHFREXE~A~ I I l l l I1l l I II I IIII I lI lI I II I I1II  FIGURE 3.

Bag. 1 cells did not respond to mIL-IO, consistent with observations that mIL- 10 is species-specific (1) and does not bind to hIL-1OR (Fig. 1). Moreover, binding of FLAG-hIL- 10 to hIL- 1OR expressed on Ba8.1 cells was not inhibited 100-fold by molarexcess of hIL-I, hIL-2, hIL-3, hIL-4, and hIL-5; binding was also not inhibited by hIL-7, hIL-13,hGM-CSF,hIFN-a,hIFN-y, hTNF-a, mIL-10, or vIL-I 0 (data not shown).  hlL-IOR mRNA expression  RNA blot analysis revealed a 3.6-kb hIL-1OR mRNA species in a number of human tissues including spleen, thymus, and PBMC (Fig. 5 A ) . Non-hemopoietic tissues revealedonly faint hybridization to thehIL-10R probe, including pancreas, skeletal muscle, brain, heart, and kidney (not shown). Placenta, lung, and liver showed intermediate levels of hIL-IOR mRNA. Possibly, much of the signal detected in these samples could be due to contaminating blood cells present during isolation of the tissues.  Human cellsthat express high levels of hIL-1OR mRNA include monocytes, B cells, LGL, and cells isolated from T fresh PBMC or spleen (Fig. 5B).Cell lines in which the 3.6-kb mRNA was detected were BJAB, DMSO-differentiated U937 cells (Fig. 5B), NK cell lines (data not shown), and various cloned human T cell lines (48) (Fig. 5 C ) . All cell populations and cell lines known to respond to IL-IO, including B cells ( 1 2), monocytes/macrophages and DMSO-differentiated U937 cells (6, lo), and T cells and T cell clones (48), expressed readily detectable levels of hIL1OR mRNA, as also observed for mIL-IOR (24). Activation of human T cell clones of several phenotypes, including Tho-like CD8' clones (GM16, GM59) and Thl -like (CR329), Th2-like (AAI1I ) , and Tho-like (HG120)CD4' clones, by anti-CD3 and PMA was associated consistently with down-regulation of the level of hIL-IOR mRNA detectedinthe cells(Fig. 5C and data not shown). With reference to p-actin mRNA as standard, the decrease in hIL- 1OR mRNA ranged from 2- to IO-fold in the samples examined, with the CD8' Tho clonestending to exhibitthe more marked decreases in hIL- 10R mRNA level.  1826  H U M A N IL-1OR  Downloaded from www.jimmunol.org on November 6, 2009  0.40 hlL-IO 12G8  c  U  ? .

The hIL-IOR probe hybridizes prominently to a MspI fragment of -3.2 kb, along with several smaller, less intense bands inhuman genomic DNA. Only cell line  With the use ofepitope-tagged hIL- IO, we identified a cell line expressing hIL- 1 OR and isolated cDNA clones encoding hIL-IOR. hIL-IOR has 70% and 60% sequence identity to mIL-IOR at the nucleic acid and protein levels, respectively (24). COS7 and Ba/F3 cells transfected withhILIOR cDNA clones express cell-surface receptors that bind hIL-IO (but not mIL-IO) specifically withhighaffinity, and Ba/F3 cells expressing rhIL-1OR are stimulated by hIL-IO but not mIL-IO(Fig. 4). rhIL-IOR is indistinguishable in size fromhIL-IOR expressed by the cells from which the cDNA was isolated, and moreover, is similar in size to mIL-IOR (Fig. 2). hIL-IOR mRNA was present in all cells examined that are knowntorespond to hIL-IO (Fig. 5). We thus conclude that the hIL-IOR identified is a functional receptor for hIL- IO, because it binds ligand specifically, mediates transduction of a biologic response to hIL-IO, and exhibits the known species-specificity of the human receptor (1, 46). We have observed significant levels of hIL-IOR mRNA expression by T cells and N W G L cells, cells about which relatively little is known concerning their direct responses to IL-IO. IL- 10 inhibits cytokine synthesis by both T cells and NK cells, but these inhibitory effects are indirect, mediated viathe monocyte/macrophage costimulatory cell (1). However, hIL-10 does enhance generation of lymphokine-activated killer activity from resting NK cells in response to IL-2 (7), and also has demonstrable inhibitory effects on IL-2 production by subsets of human T cells and T cell clones (48, 50). In addition, mIL-IO costimulates growth of mouse thymocytes and T cells (14), and enhances generation of cytotoxic T cell activity (15). NK/ LGL cells express a significant level of hIL-IOR mRNA, especially when compared with the p-actin reference standard (Fig. 5B). T cells and T cell clones also express readily detectable hIL-IOR mRNA, which is down-regulated in the latter in response to activation by anti-CD3 and PMA (Fig. 5A, C). We do not presently know the significance of the observed down-regulation of hIL-IOR mRNA expression, especially because it is unclear whether even an 8- to IO-fold lower hIL- IOR number would significantly impair the ability of activated T cells to respond to IL-IO. Loss of IL-IOR expression by activated T cells might render these cells insensitive to inhibition by IL-10 except for indirect effectsmediated by macrophages/monocytes. In any case, the expression of significant levels of hIL-IOR mRNA by T and N K cells andits regulation by activation stimuli suggest possible  Downloaded from www.jimmunol.org on November 6, 2009  1828  HUMAN IL-1 OR  additional,as yet uncharacterized effects of IL-IO on T cells and NK cells. The K , value of hIL-IOR is larger than that obtained for `251-labeled hIL- 10 bindingto mIL-1OR (-70 pM) expressed on transfected Ba/F3 (BaMR29) cells (24); this is consistent with the observation that hIL- 10 has an order of magnitude greater sp. act. in stimulation of BaMR29 cells compared with Ba8.1 cells (A. Ho and K. W. Moore, unpublishedobservation). This finding may suggest an intrinsically higher affinity of mIL-IOR for ligand. Alternatively, it is possible that additional receptor or signalling components provided in trans by (mouse) B e 3 cells interact much more efficiently with mIL-IOR than with hIL10R due to the species difference. Like the cellular cytokine, vIL-IO inhibits macrophage activation and stimulates human and mouse B cells (1). The finding that vIL-IO at 100-fold molar excess did not detectably compete with FLAG-hIL- I O for binding to hILIOR, although at 500-fold molar excess vIL-IO competed slightly with FLAG-hIL-IO(data not shown), thus provides further evidence for the possible existence of additional IL-1OR components on human B cells and activated monocytes. Moreover, we have so far been unable to detect significant levels of binding of FLAG-vIL- 10 to either Ba8.1 or COS7 cellsexpressing hIL-IOR using FACS analysis. hIL-IOR, along with mIL-IOR (24), are new members of the class I1 subgroup of CR, the IFNR family. Many of the activating effects of IFN-y on macrophages are inhibited by IL-IO (1).The structures of theligand-binding chains of IFN-aPR and IFN-yR are known (43, 51, 52), but biologic and genetic evidence has been accumulated for the existence of an additional IFNR polypeptide(s) involved in transduction of a biologic signal (see for example (53)). In this light, and in view of the demonstration of sharedsubunits among receptors for different cytokines (54, 5 5 ) , it is possible that IL-1OR could likewise share a secondreceptorchain with anIFNR. If so, IL-IOand IFN-y might compete for binding to each other's receptors, but as noted above, neither IFN-a nor IFN-y competed for hIL-10 binding to rhIL- IOR. However, in the IL3, IL5, and GM-CSF receptor system (45) a group of CRs shares a common secondary chain, but each CR is only capable of bindingitsrespectivecytokine.Further possibilities are that the IL- 10 and IFN signal transduction pathways may share common features, or that the IL-10/ IL-IOR interactionmightdirectlyantagonize the IFNR signal transduction pathway (56, 57), perhaps by interacting with or sequestering one or more of its components. These suggestions are plausible in view of recent evidence that IL-IO and IFN-y both activate a transcription factor thatinteracts with IFN-responseelements in the FcyRI gene (58) andinduceFcyRexpression(59).Further characterization of the structure and signal transduction mechanisms of IL-1OR and IFNR may illuminate these possibilities.

Introduction  The reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a major mechanism by which eukaryotic cellular functions are controlled, the regulation of protein phosphatases being an integral part of this control mechanism [1,2]. Specific targetting subunits have been identified which bind PPl catalytic subunits (PPl C) to particular subcellular locations and modulate their activity. In skeletal muscle, a 124 kDa targetting subunit associates with PPlC to form a heterodimer referred to as PPlG which binds to glycogen with high affinity and enhances dephosphorylation of glycogen-bound PPl substrates, such as glycogen synthase and phosphorylase kinase, but not non-glycogenassociated substrates such as myosin P-light chain (reviewed in [3,4]). Phosphorylation of the G subunit in response to insulin enhances the activity of PPlG towards glycogen-bound substrates [5] while phosphorylation of the G subunit in response to adrenaline causes dissociation of PPlC from the G subunit [6]. Interestingly, the G subunit also associates with the sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscle [7,8]. Thus, a single targetting subunit can localise the catalytic subunit to at least two target loci. *Corresponding author.

Other targetting subunits interact with PPlC. In smooth muscle, PPlC associates with a 130 kDa and a 20 kDa subunit to form PPlM [9]. This heterotrimer has enhanced activity towards phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin, but reduced activity towards phosphorylase, compared with PPlC. Striated muscle also contains a PPlM complex which has enhanced activity (relative to PPlC) towards skeletal muscle myosin [lo]. A 1618 kDa protein, termed NIPP-1, forms an inhibitory complex with nuclear PPlC in mammalian cells, the inhibition being relieved by phosphorylation [l 11,while in fission yeast, the 30 kDa protein product of the sds22 gene is a nuclear protein which may modulate the activity of PPlC towards nuclear substrates [ 121. In addition to its interaction with targetting subunits, PPlC binds to two cytosolic proteins, inhibitor 1 (I-l) and inhibitor 2 (I-2), which completely abolish its activity at nanomolar concentrations [ 1,131. These small thermostable proteins sequester free PPlC into heterodimerit and thus prevent unwanted complexes, dephosphorylation events. In addition, I-2 has been shown to act like a molecular chaperone, being required to fold three bacterially expressed isofoims of PPl into a conformation with the same properties as the native enzyme [ 141. Since PPlC comprises a major portion of cellular phosphatase activity and dephosphorylates many phosphoproteins in vitro, it is likely that other targetting subunits exist for this enzyme. In an attempt to isolate such proteins, we have utilised the yeast two hybrid sys 0014-5793/94/$7.00  0 1994 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. All rights reserved.

IFEBS Letters 340 (1994) 93-98 A,, of 0.5 in YPD or selective media, harvested by centrifugation, washed in 100~1 of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM &amp;mercaptoethanol, then resuspended in 100~1 of lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl (PH 7.0). 2 mM EDTA. 7 mM B-mercaotoethanol, 1 mM r ------PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine). 100 il of glass beads (500 pm diameter) were added and the tubes vortexed for 10 min at 4°C. The lysate was collected by puncturing the bottom of the tube with a hot 23-gauge needle, placing the tube inside another 1.5 ml microfuge tube and centrifuging in a bench-top centrifuge at 2,000xg for 3 min. The extract in the bottom tube was centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. Protein extracts were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and stained with Coomassie blue R-250. Blotting onto nitrocellulose (BA 85, Schleicher and Schuell) was performed using a Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Non-specific protein binding was reduced by incubation in TSTM (5% Marvel dried milk powder in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was incubated for 1 h in a l/1000 dilution of anti-HA antibody in TSTM, then developed using the Vectastain alkaline phosphatase system (Vector laboratories).  tern [15,16,17]. This method employs the yeast GAL4 transcription factor which can be dissected into autonomous DNA-binding and transcription-activating domains. When two fusion proteins, each containing a separate half of the GAL4 protein, are brought together via interaction of their heterologous proteins, an active GAL4 transcription complex is reconstituted. The latter then activates a suitable reporter gene which allows a screen to be performed. This and similar systems have been used successfully by several groups to confirm suspected protein-protein interactions [ 18,191 or to identify novel protein-protein interactions using libraries of fusion proteins [16,17,20]. Here we describe the use of PPly, cDNA [21] in the two hybrid system to isolate a cDNA encoding the human protein phosphatase inhibitor 2. We present the complete coding sequence of the human I-2 cDNA together with purification and characterisation of I-2 protein expressed in E. coli.  2. Materials and methods 2.1. Bacterial and yeast strains E. coli strain DHSa (supE44 dlacU169@80 lacZdM15) hsdRl7 recA1 endA gyrA96 thi-I relA1) were the transformation recipient for all plasmid constructions except during the expression of I-2 in E. coli, when E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen) was used. The S. cerevisiue host used in the yeast two hybrid system was Y 190 [ 16,171.  This strain contains a mutatedCYH gene, resulting in resistance to cycloheximide at 2.5 &amp;ml. 2.2. Media and materials E. coli were grown on Luria Broth (LB) plates or in liquid media which was LB or terrilic broth (TB) supplemented as necessary with chloramphenicol (25 &amp;ml) and/or ampicillin (50-100 &amp;ml). Yeast were grown on YPD, YAPD or synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking appropriate amino acids [22]. For library screening in yeast, 3aminotriazole (3-AT, Sigma) was included at 40 mM final concentration in SC minus tryptophan (Trp), leucine (Leu) and histidine (His). For detection of /?-galactosidase activity, yeast were grown on SC-X plates lacking His, Leu and Trp. SC-X plates contain SC medium as above plus: 100 mM KH,PO,, 15 mM (NH,),SOI, 75 mM KOH, 0.8 mM MgSO,, 2 PM Fe,(SO,), (pH adjusted to 7.0 with 1 M KOH) and 0.1 mg/ml X-Gal added immediately before pouring plates (L.H. Johnston, NIMR, London; personal communication). Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Boehringer or Amersham, Taq polymerase from Promega, T4 DNA ligase from Amersham and Zymolyase from ICN-Flow. dNTPs and ATP were purchased from Pharmacia and [(z-`SS]dATPand [y-"P]ATP from Amersham. Oligonucleotides were synthesised by Alastair I. Murchie (University of Dundee) on an Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA synthesizer. The anti-HA antibody (ref: PO(Bl0 59367) used for immunoblotting was obtained from the Berkeley Antibody Co. Bacterially expressed PPly, was purified as in [14]. Native PPl and PP2A catalytic subunits were purified from rabbit skeletal muscle by Dr. Carol MacKintosh and Dr. Don Schelling, respectively [27]. 2.3. Construction of the pASPPly, plasmid The coding region of the cloned human PPly, cDNA [21] was amplified by PCR as detailed previously [14]. This product was digested with NdeI and BumHI restriction endonucleases and cloned into the NdeIBamHI sites of plasmid pAS2 [17]. 2.4. Extraction of proteins from yeast and Western blotting  2.5. Library screening Yeast strain Y190 containing plasmid pASPPly, was grown in 100 ml of SC minus Trp medium at 28°C until a density of 1~10~cell/ml was obtained. This culture was diluted 5 times into YAPD (total volume 500 ml) and regrown until the cell density was again lxlO'/ml. Transformation with 50 pg of human peripheral B lymphocyte cDNA library in plasmid PACT [ 161was performed according to [24]. Equal portions of the transformation mix were spread onto 300 mm plates containing SC minus Trp, Leu, His plus 40 mM 3-AT and incubated at 28°C. Portions of the transformation mix were also spread on SC minus Leu and SC minus Leu, Trp plates to determine transformation frequency. Colonies that grew were replated on SC medium minus Trp, Leu, His plus 40 mM 3-AT, then tested for B-galactosidase activity by plating on SC-X plates. Colonies that turned blue after incubation for up to 2-3 days were analysed further. 2.6. Recovery of plasmids from yeast and sequence analysis Total yeast nucleic acid was prepared according to [22] except that RNase was not added. The nucleic acid was then used to transform electrocompetent E. coli by electroporation using an `Easyject plus' (Equibio) electroporator according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transformants were plated on LB plates containing ampicillin and plasmid DNA was prepared from single colonies 1251.Plasmid DNA was digested with restriction endonuciease BgZII and-fragments separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Plasmids not generating DNA fragments characteristic of the pASpp1 y, construct digested with BgiII were analysed further. DNA sequence analysis was performed using either [a-"S]dATP and Seauenase enzvme accordine to the manufacturer's instructions (US Biochemicals) or an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer, again according to the manufacturer's instructions, using Taq dye terminator cycle sequencing. 2.7. Expression of I-2 in E. coli The open reading frame region of the human I-2 cDNA sequence was amplified by PCR using the two oligonucleotides 02999 (S-GCGCCATATGGCGGCCTCGACGGCCTC-3') and 02939 (5'-ACTTTGTAAGAGCTACCAC-33. Oligonucleotide 02999 creates an NdeI site (underlined in oligonucleotide sequence) at the initiating methionine codon (in italics) and the priming site for oligonucleotide 02939 resides in the 3' non-coding region of the cDNA downstream of a unique C/u1 site at position +790 with respect to the A of the initiating methionine codon. Digestion of the PCR product with restriction endonucleases NdeI and CIaI allowed the complete I-2 coding sequence to be cloned into the NdeI-ClaI sites of the plasmid pT7-7 [26] to generate plasmid pT7-12. After verifying that the sequence of the pT7-I2 construct was into E. coli strain correct, the plasmid was transformed BL21(DE3)pLysS and transformants selected on LB plates containing ampicillin (50 fig/ml) and chloramphenicol(25 &amp;ml). A single colony was inoculated into 5 ml LB containing ampicillin (100 &amp;ml) and chloramphenicol (25 &amp;ml) and grown overnight at 37°C. This was then diluted 1:100 into 2 litres of the same culture medium and grown  Crude cell extracts containing soluble proteins were prepared from yeast cells by a modification of [23]. 2.5 ml cultures were grown to an  N.

After continued incubation at 37°C for 3 h, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v)/3-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine). The suspension was incubated in a boiling water bath for 15 min with stirring, cooled on ice, then insoluble material removed by centrifugation at 25,OOOxgfor 15 min. The supernatant was sonicated for 1 min using a Jencons probe sonicator (model GE 50) to shear chromosomal DNA, incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, cooled and centrifuged at 45,OOOxgfor 20 min. The supematant was loaded onto a HiLoad 16110Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) which was developed with a 400 ml O-500 mM linear NaCl gradient. The peak fractions of I-2 which duted at 280 mM NaCl were pooled and the buffer was exchanged for 20 mM NH, acetate (pH 5), 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT using an Amicon 8050 stirred cell with a YMlO filter. After incubating in a boiling water bath for 5 min then cooling, the sample was loaded onto a Mono Q column (Pharmacia) and developed with a 40 ml O-250 mM linear NaCl gradient. The peak fraction of I-2 which eluted at 170 mM NaCl was collected and stored at -2O'C. 2.8. Protein phosphatase and inhibitor 2 assays 32P-labelled rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen phosphorylase was prepared by phosphorylation with phosphorylase kinase to a stoichiometry of 1 mol phosphate per mol subunit [27]. The specific activity of the [~-32plATP used for all phosphorylations was lo6 cpm/nmol. Phosphatase assays were performed in the absence of divalent cations [27] using the above substrate. One unit of phosphatase activity is that amount of enzyme which catalyses the release of 1pmol [3zP]phosphate/ min from phosphorylase a. Inhibitor 2 was assayed as in [ZS].One unit of I-2 was that amount which inhibits the dephospho~lation of 0.01 mU of PPl by 50% in the standard 30 ~1 assay.  3. Results 3.1. Isolation of the human inhibitor 2 cDNA using the yeast two hybrid system  After cloning the complete open reading frame of human PPly, into the pAS2 plasmid, expression of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain-PPly, fusion protein in S. cerevisiue strain Y190 was verified by immunoblotting using the anti-HA antibody, which recognises an epitope attached to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. A band of the expected molecular mass (50 kDa) was seen only in protein extracts from yeast cells containing the pASPPly, plasmid (data not shown). This construct did not activate transcription from the UAS, (the DNA sequence which binds GALA) as detected by lack of growth of Y190 cells containing the plasmid on SC minus His medium containing 40 mM 3-AT. In order to isolate proteins capable of interacting with PPlrr, yeast cells containing the pASPP1 y1 construct were transformed with DNA from a PACT library containing human peripheral B lymphocyte cDNA sequences fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain. After growth on the selection medium for 12 days, ten colonies were obtained, representing 0.005% of the cells transformed.

The amino acid sequence of rabbit I-2 is shown below the human sequence. Identities with the human sequenceare indicatedby periods. Numbering within the cDNA is with respect to the first nucleotide of the initiation codon. Numbering of the amino acids is from the Ala following the initiating Met,which is cleaved from the mature protein, and corresponds with that used in [29]. The polyadenylation signal within the human I-2 cDNA is underlined.  96  N. R. He&amp;s et al. I FE&amp;S Letters 340 11994) 93-98  M 123  4  Fig. 2. Purification of human inhibitor 2 from E. coli induced to express the protein for 3 h. Samples of protein from various stages of the purification procedure were separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE and visualised by staining with Coomassie blue. Tracks are: (1) 7,ug of total E. coli protein; (2) 3 pg of protein from boiled E. cob extract; (3) 1 pg of protein from Q-Sepharose fraction containing peak 1-2 activity; (4) 1 fig of protein from Mono-Q fraction containing peak I-2 activity. Markers are in kDa. Human I-2 protein is indicated by an arrow.  colonies were taken through another round of selection on medium containing 3-AT, then plated onto SC-X plates to determine whether they possessed ,&amp;galactosidase activity. Seven of the original ten colonies showed a blue colour, indicating that the /?-galactosidase gene was being transcribed and translated in these transformants (data not shown). PACT plasmids were recovered from these clones and their inserts sequenced. One clone was found to encode a protein with very high similarity to the rabbit skeletal muscle inhibitor 2 protein [29]; a specific and potent inhibitor of PPl activity 1301. 3.2. Sequence of the humus inhibitor-2 cDNA Fig. 1 shows the complete coding and 3' non-coding sequence of the human I-2 cDNA. The predicted human I-2 protein contains 205 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 23,015 Da. Fig. 1 also shows a comparison of the predicted human and rabbit [29,31,32] I-2 protein sequences. The two proteins share 92% sequence identity, which rises to 95% sequence similarity if conservative changes are included. 3.3. rsolat~o~ and ~~ope~t~es of humus inhibitor 2 expressed in E. coli  amounts at 3 h, when it constitutes approximately 2% of total E. coli protein. The I-2 protein was purified from cultures of E. coli induced for 3 h with a final yield of 20% (Fig. 2, Table 1). The purification procedure takes advantage of the known properties of the I-2 protein. The first heating step removes over 90% of contaminating proteins without loss of I-2. The two column steps exploit the low number of histidine residues in I-2. Hence, at markedly different pH values, the protein elutes from anion exchange columns at similar salt concentrations. This allows contaminating proteins to be separated from the major peak of activity. The I-2 protein purified by this method consisted essentially of a single product migrating at 3 1 kDa on SDS-PAGE, although a minor product of slightly smaller size was also seen (Fig. 2). N-terminal sequencing of the protein preparation confirmed that the major protein present was I-2 and that this protein lacked the N-terminal methionine residue. This analysis also showed that the minor contaminant is a degradation product of I-2, which initiated 13 amino acids after the N-terminal methionine (data not shown). The purified human I-2 was assayed for its ability to inhibit type 1 and type 2A protein phosphatases in the standard phosphorylase phosphatase assay [27]. It inhibited the bacterially expressed PPIy, catalytic subunit [21] as well as native PPlC purified from rabbit skeletal muscle [27] with an I&amp; of 1-2 nM, and had no effect on the activity of PP2A catalytic subunit, in accordance with the properties of I-2 protein purified from rabbit skeletal muscle [28] (Fig. 3).  4. Discussion We have used the yeast two hybrid system [16] to identify novel proteins which interact with a human protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit, PPly, [21]. One such protein was found to be 92% identical in sequence to the rabbit skeletal muscle inhibitor 2 [29], and therefore presumed to be the human homologue. This was confirmed by expression of the human I-2 in E. coli, followed by examination of its properties. Since I-2 was previously known to interact with PPl (reviewed in [I]), our studies demonstrate that the yeast two hybrid system  In order to express human I-2 protein in bacteria the complete coding sequence was cloned into the E. coli expression vector pT7-7 as described in the materials and methods section. Induction of cultures containing the expression vector resulted in production of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa on SDSPAGE (Fig. 2). Although this is larger than that predicted from the sequence, it agrees well with the estimated size of rabbit I-2 on SDS-PAGE [29] which is also known to migrate aberrantly in this eiectrophoretic system. Human I-2 is detectable in boiled extracts 30 min after the start of induction and is present in maximai  Table 1 Purification of human I-2 from E.  coli  expressing the full-length protein Specific activity Wmg) 5.4x 7.5 x 1.4x 2.6x Yield Purifica(8) tion (-fold) 1 14 26 48  Total Volume Total protein activity (ml) (mg) (u) Culture Boiled sin Q-Sepharose Mono-Q 2000 148 8x lo6 40 11.2 8.4 x lo6 24 2.9 4x106 1.5 0.57 1.5x lo6  lo4 100 lo5 105 lo6 51 lo6 19  N.R.

Effect of bacterially expressed human I-2 on the activity of PPl (0) and PP2A (0) catalytic subunits purified from skeletal muscle.  is applicable to the isolation of PPlC-associated proteins. In addition, recent studies looking for proteins interacting with retinoblastoma protein identified an interaction between a putative PPlC isoform using the same system [16]. The sequence of human I-2, deduced from the cDNA is one amino acid longer than the rabbit sequence encoded by the cDNA isolated by Zhang et al. [32]; the extra amino acid being a serine residue at the C-terminus. However, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of I-2 peptides predicted a C-terminal serine in the rabbit protein [31] additional to the sequence originally determined by the Edman method [29]. N-Terminal sequencing of the bacterially expressed human inhibitor 2 revealed that the initiating methionine residue is removed in E. coli. This may also occur in human cells, since rabbit I-2 purified from skeletal muscle lacks an initiating methionine encoded by the rabbit cDNA [29,32]. Although the human I-2 sequence determined here is from B lymphocytes, it is unlikely to be different in other tissues, since I-2 has been shown to be immunologically identical in a variety of rabbit tissues [33]. The overall identity of the human and rabbit I-2 sequences is 92%, and this high conservation of sequence between mammalian species might be expected, since human and rabbit PPla catalytic subunit sequences are identical [34] as are their PPl/? sequences [35]. It has been known for several years that inhibitor 2 can be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3  (GSK3) on Thr-72 and by casein kinase II (CKII) on Ser-86, Ser-120 and Ser-121 [36], but it has only recently been demonstrated that one function of phosphorylation of Thr-72 allows newly synthesized PPl to adopt its native conformation [14]. The phosphorylation of Ser-86 by CKII appears to increase the rate of phosphorylation of Thr-72 by GSK3 [37]. As would be expected Thr-72 and the serine residues at 86, 120 and 121, are conserved between the rabbit and human proteins. A search of the GenEMBL data base with the human I-2 cDNA sequence showed that 0.12 kb of the 3'-untranslated region of human I-2 (nucleotides 1115-1235) exhibits 90% identity to a section near one end of a genomic DNA sequence containing the class II major histocompatibility (MHC) complex on the short arm of chromosome 6 [38]. Since this fragment just precedes the polyA tail in the I-2 cDNA, it is unlikely that its presence in the cDNA is an artefact. The region was not known to be transcribed in the MHC complex. However, the occurrence of only 90% identity between the cDNA and the genomic DNA indicates that a pseudogene or second gene for I-2 is more likely to be present near the MHC complex, rather than the gene encoding the I-2 sequence identified here. Expression of human I-2 in E. coli enabled isolation of ~0.5 mg of the pure protein from 2 litres of bacterial culture. The pure human I-2 protein inhibited PPlC activity in the standard phosphorylase phosphatase assay with an IC,, of 1 nM, while having no inhibitory effect on the PP2A catalytic subunit. Thus the expressed human I-2 protein purified from E. coli behaved identically to I-2 protein purified from rabbit skeletal muscle. The availability of large amounts of pure I-2 protein will allow further characterisation of the properties of this protein, including its interaction with PPlC. It can also provide a valuable source of I-2 for general use in protein phosphatase assays. Acknowledgements: We thank Dr. David G. Campbell for N-terminal protein sequence analysis.

In the presence of hormone, these complexes dissociate, leaving the 4S form of the receptor that is capable of dimerization and binding to DNA. In the absence of hormone, the native avian progesterone receptor (PR) associates with hsp9o, hsp7o, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and p23 (30). The binding of these proteins is salt dependent and stabilized by molybdate (30). As the components of the various steroid receptor complexes have been examined (reviewed in references 22 and 34), hsp90 has been found in association with glucocorticoid, androgen, estrogen, and mineralocorticoid receptors, as well as PR. Comparative studies on the other receptor-associated proteins are less complete. hsp70 has been observed with chicken and mammalian PR (12, 20) and with some forms of the glucocorticoid receptor (27). A 59-kDa heat shock protein (p59, hsp56) (26) associates with mammalian progesterone, estrogen, androgen, and glucocorticoid receptors (37). p59 has been shown to bind the immunosuppressant drug FK506 (14, 36, 39). It belongs to the family of FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) and has also been called FKBP52 (21). The p54 and p50 proteins seen in the chick PR complex have recently been shown to belong to the same family of FKBPs, with p50 more closely related to p59 (29). Thus, with the exception of p23, the major receptor-associated proteins have been identified as either heat shock proteins or immunophilins even though their significance to receptor structure and function remains unclear. In this report we characterize p23, the 23-kDa protein  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  originally found in the chicken PR complex. p23 is also present in some hsp90 complexes. p23 is a highly conserved, novel protein with no structural homology to known proteins. In addition, antibodies which specifically immunoprecipitate p23 coprecipitate the chicken PR along with hsp90 and hsp70. MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of tissue cytosol. Oviduct cytosol was freshly prepared from estradiol-stimulated chicks (31). Soluble tissue homogenates from chicken brain, liver, oviduct, and spleen; mouse liver; and guinea pig liver were prepared in 4 volumes of 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4)-10 mM thioglycerol homogenization buffer as previously described (31). Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) extract was prepared by vortexing the yeast pellet in 10 volumes of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer in the presence of glass beads. HeLa cell S100 extract was a gift from Jay Tichelaar. Untreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was purchased from Green Hectares (Oregon, Wis.).  * Corresponding author.

Mouse monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody PR22 against the avian PR has been described (35). Antibody D7oc against avian hsp90 was prepared by Brugge and coworkers (3). Antibodies to p23 were prepared as described below. These include an IgM mouse monoclonal antibody, R3; four mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies, JJ3, JJ5, JJ6, and JJ1O; and a rabbit antiserum against a p23 peptide, p23t2. Immunoprecipitation of PR, hsp9O, and p23 complexes. PR22 or D7a monoclonal antibody (20 p.g) or 10 RI of p23 monoclonal antibody ascites was preincubated with 25 ,ul of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 30 min at room temperature and then washed with homogenization buffer. One milliliter of cytosol was added to each 25-pA resin pellet. After 1 h on ice, with gentle resuspension every 5 min, the pellet was washed 1956  VOL. 14, 1994  A 23-kDa PROTEIN OF PR COMPLEXES  1957  four times with 1 ml of homogenization buffer, and extracted dire tly into SDS sample buffer before analysis by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For the peptide competition studies with the JJ3 and JJ5 antibodies, 75 p.g of peptide was added to the cytosol during the 1-h immunoprecipitation. were  Gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Samples extracted into SDS sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% 3-mercaptoethanol. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were prepared as described previously (13). Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. For Western blotting (immunoblotting), SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) as described elsewhere (12). For blotting p23, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody at a 1:2,000 dilution overnight at 4°C, washed, incubated with the appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse second antibody for 30 min, washed, and stained with 5-bromo4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. The p23t2 antiserum was used at a 1:1,000 dilution with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG second antibody. Obtaining peptide sequence for p23. Immunoprecipitated PR and hsp9o complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol were resolved on a 10% gel. After the position of p23 was determined by staining the edges of the gel with Coomassie blue, p23 was excised and electroeluted with either a Centricon Electroeluter (Amicon, Beverly, Mass.) or a Six-Pac Electroeluter (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. The electroeluted protein was dialyzed into 5 mM NH4HCO3 and precipitated with either ethanol (40) or chloroform-methanol (38). The pellet was resuspended and digested with either trypsin or cyanogen bromide (CNBr) essentially as described previously (33). Microsequencing of peptide fragments. Protein sequencing and peptide synthesis were conducted in The Protein Sequencing/Peptide Synthesis Resource Laboratory, Mayo Clinic, directed by Daniel J. McCormick. After treatment of p23 with trypsin or CNBr, peptide fragments were resolved by highperformance liquid chromatography with an ABI Aquapore OD-300 C18 column. Individual peptides were sequenced from the amino terminus by gas-phase Edman degradation. Synthetic peptide synthesis. Peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods, using the 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl protection scheme. The two internal peptides, p23t2 (residues 49 to 63) and surfI (residues 60 to 75), were synthesized on Rink resin, and the C-terminal peptide, surf2 (residues 143 to 160), was synthesized on Wang resin. Cysteines were added to the C terminus of the purified internal peptides and the N terminus of the C-terminal peptide for conjugation to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, Ill.). Development of polyclonal antisera to p23. The synthetic peptide p23t2, LNEIDLFSNIDPNE, was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin to raise rabbit polyclonal antiserum. The second test bleed was reactive with p23 on a Western blot of chick oviduct cytosol. The polyclonal antiserum was affinity purified on an antigen column. Briefly, bovine serum albuminconjugated peptide was covalently cross-linked to ACTIGELALD according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sterogene Bioseparations, Arcadia, Calif.). Polyclonal antiserum diluted 1:10 in 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) was bound to the column and washed extensively with 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and then with 500 mM NaCl-10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). The p23-specific antibodies were eluted into I M Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) with 100 mM glycine-Cl (pH 2.5) and then with 100 mM triethylamine-Cl  (pH 11.5), pooled, and dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline by the method of Harlow and Lane (6). Immunoscreening of cDNA expression libraries. A Clontech chicken 5'-Stretch cDNA brain library (catalog number CL1I016b) was screened with R3 antibody and purified polyclonal antiserum by conventional methods. Plaques positive on tertiary screens were used for large-scale phage preparations performed by the glycerol gradient step method (25). The phage DNA was digested with EcoRI, and the insert was subcloned into pGEM 7zf(-) (Promega, Madison, Wis.) by conventional methods (25). Double-stranded sequencing was performed on two independent subclones by using [35S]dATP and the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemicals). Library screening with labeled RNA probe from a partial clone. A Clontech human testis cDNA library (catalog number HL101Ob) was screened with an [ot_-32P]GTP-labeled RNA probe synthesized from the partial chicken clone. The prehybridization and hybridization of the labeled RNA probe to nylon filters (Amersham, Inc.) were carried out in 5 x SSPE (1 x SSPE is 0.18 M NaCl, 0.01 M NaH2PO4, and 0.001 M EDTA), 50% formamide, 5 x Denhardt's solution (1 x Denhardt's solution is 0.02% [wt/vol] bovine serum albumin, 0.02% [wt/vol] Ficoll [Pharmacia], and 0.02% [wt/vol] polyvinylpyrrolidone), 0.5% (wt/vol) SDS, and 0.25 mg of denatured sonicated salmon sperm DNA at 40°C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bacterial expression of human p23. A full-length human p23 PCR product was generated by using the forward p23-specific primer 5'-CGTTCACAATGGATCCTGCTTCTTGC-3' and a reverse vector-specific SP6 primer. The 650-bp PCR product was digested with BamHI and subcloned into the Invitrogen (San Diego, Calif.) pTrcHis expression vector. The resulting 26-kDa fusion protein replaces the original two amino acids of the native sequence with the additional amino-terminal sequence MGGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDD DDKD. Escherichia coli TOPIO (Invitrogen) containing the expression vector was grown at 37°C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.3, induced with 1 mM isopropylthio-p-D-galactoside and harvested 4 h later. Soluble cell extract was prepared by resuspending and sonicating the pellet in 20 mM sodium phosphate-500 mM sodium chloride (pH 7.8). Recombinant p23 elutes from a DEAE-cellulose column during a 0.4 M KCI step elution as a highly purified protein. Collection and dialysis of peak fractions yield approximately 10 mg of 50 to 70% pure p23 per liter of culture. Monoclonal antibody production. Mouse monoclonal antibody R3 was prepared by the intrasplenic immunization method of Nilsson and Larsson (19). PR complexes immunoprecipitated from chick oviduct cytosol were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and stained with Coomassie blue. The p23 band was excised and inserted directly into the spleens of three mice. This was repeated after 1 month, and cell fusion was performed 5 days later. Hybridoma culture supernatants were tested for p23 antibodies by Western blotting against preparations of PR complex. Additional antibodies were prepared by conventional subcutaneous injection with p23 expressed in E. coli and purified on DEAE-cellulose. Hybridoma supernatants were tested on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates coated with recombinant p23, yielding nine positive hybridomas. Reconstitution of PR complex with 35S-labeled p23. [35S]methionine-labeled p23 was produced by using the TNT T7coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, Wis.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

After 2 h the lysate was divided into three reaction mixtures, and Promega untreated lysate (catalog number L4150) was added to a volume of 200 RI. An ATP regenerating system (32) was also added at this time. Chick oviduct cytosol was prepared as described above, adjusted to 0.5 M KCl, and incubated on ice for 30 min. One and a half milliliters of this salt-stripped cytosol was added to each 25-plA protein A-PR22 antibody resin mixture. After a 1-h incubation on ice, the pellets were washed four times (1 ml each wash) in 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). The reticulocyte lysate mixture was added to the PR resin pellet and incubated at 30°C for 30 min with mixing every 5 min. To activate the receptor, 2 X 10-7 M (final concentration) progesterone was added as indicated and the 30°C incubation was continued for an additional 30 min. The samples were washed five times (1 ml each wash) with 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Computer analysis of sequence. All computer analyses of DNA and protein sequences were done with the Genetics Computer Group (GCG; Madison, Wis.) sequence analysis software package. Nucleotide sequence accession number. The human p23 cDNA and chicken p23 cDNA sequences have been submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers L24804 and L24898, respectively. RESULTS  p23 was first observed as a component of the unactivated complex of the avian PR (30). However, its existence is not confined to receptor complexes, since it has also been isolated in complexes with the 90-kDa heat shock protein, hsp90 (33). A typical immunoprecipitation of chick oviduct PR with the monoclonal antibody PR22 is shown in Fig. 1 (left panel). The PR22 antibody recognizes the B and A forms of the receptor (35). Five additional proteins, hsp9O, hsp7O, p54, p50, and p23,  have been shown to specifically copurify with the PR (30). The positions of PR B and A, hsp90, hsp70, and p23 are shown. The identities of these proteins were confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). The heavy chain of the antibody obscures the p54 and p50 proteins. From densitometric analysis of Coomassie blue-stained gels, the molar ratio of p23 to PR appears to be approximately 1:1 (30). The proteins copurifying with the chick oviduct hsp90 immunoprecipitated with D7a are also shown in Fig. 1 (right panel). These proteins have been identified on Western blots as hsp7o, p60, and p23 (33; data not shown). The major proteins that specifically copurify with hsp90 are hsp7o and a stress-related protein termed p60 (33). p60 is a homolog of the yeast stress protein, STI1 (18), and this protein has also been shown to be up-regulated by viral transformation of human cells (9). p23 is less abundant than the above proteins but is still very evident. Immunoscreening of chicken cDNA expression libraries. Peptide fragment sequences obtained from gel-purified chicken p23 digested with trypsin or CNBr are shown in Fig. 2 (left panel). These peptide fragments indicated that p23 was a novel protein. p23 in chick oviduct cytosol can be detected on Western blots with the mouse IgM monoclonal antibody, R3, which was raised against gel-purified p23 (Fig. 2, lane 2). Initial screening of Clontech 5'-stretch liver and brain libraries with antibody R3 resulted in the isolation of numerous falsepositive clones, prompting us to generate polyclonal antiserum against the longest trypsin fragment, LNEIDLFSNIDPNE. This antiserum, p23t2, specifically recognizes p23 on a Western blot with chick oviduct cytosol, and this interaction can be inhibited by free peptide (Fig. 2, lanes 3 to 5). Western blotting of a two-dimensional gel confirmed that the peptide antiserum was specific for p23 (data not shown). After peptide affinity column purification to remove unrelated antibodies, this antiserum was used to screen a Clontech 5'-stretch brain library. One clone, c23e, that was positive and competed with free peptide was isolated. This clone was also detected with antibody R3.

The full-length human coding sequence is deduced from the cDNA sequence. The chicken sequence is a composite of amino-terminal sequence and partial cDNA sequence (residues 16 to 160). The rabbit sequence was Human  Chicken  p23 cDNA and protein sequence. The 468-bp partial clone, c23e, encodes an open reading frame of 145 amino acids, including the four peptides obtained from sequenced fragments of chicken p23 (data not shown). An [a-32P]GTPlabeled c23e RNA probe was used to screen a human testis cDNA library. Three clones, all with inserts of approximately the same size, were isolated. One of these clones was selected for further characterization and found to contain an insert 782 nucleotides in length. This clone, Hp23C, represents the complete coding sequence of p23 and also contains 232 bp of 5' untranslated sequence and 70 bp of 3' untranslated sequence (Fig. 3). The human cDNA encodes an open reading frame of 160 amino acids (Fig. 3). The four peptide sequences obtained from chicken p23 (Fig. 2) correspond closely to the human sequence and are underlined in Fig. 3. p23 is highly conserved, with the chicken and human sequences being 96.3% identical at the amino acid level (Fig. 4). p23 is a very hydrophilic protein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy terminus. The predicted pl of 4.2 is in good agreement with the observed pl of 4.5 to 5.2 from SDS-polyacrylamide and isoelectrofocusing gels (30). The predicted molecular mass of p23 is only 18.7 kDa, whereas p23 migrates at approximately 23 kDa on SDSpolyacrylamide gels. To determine whether we had correctly identified the amino terminus of p23, we obtained aminoterminal peptide sequence from SDS-PAGE-purified chicken and rabbit p23. The chicken and rabbit amino-terminal p23 sequences are identical to the derived amino terminus of the  obtained by amino-terminal sequencing of gel-purified rabbit p23 transferred to Problott. The chicken and human sequences are 96.3% identical, with the differences marked with asterisks. Searches revealed no homologies with known proteins in either the Swiss-Prot or NBRF-PIR data bases.  human p23 clone (Fig. 4). Thus, the size discrepancy is due to either decreased mobility of p23 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels or posttranslational modification. A search against GenBank (1) nucleic acid sequences re vealed  extensive homology between the Hp23C clone and the opposite strand of the 5' untranslated region of the human zinc finger 6 (ZNF6) locus (16) (GenBank accession number X56465). As published, this sequence contains multiple frameshifts in the p23 coding sequence. Relative to the 3' end of the p23 coding sequence, the ZNF6 sequence and the Hp23C clone are &amp;gt;98% identical, with only 7 nucleotide differences over 565 nucleotides, at which point the sequences diverge. The location of the p23 sequence in the untranslated region of the ZNF6 locus raises the possibility that the sequence represents a p23 pseudogene. Because the homology is over 98% identical throughout the p23 coding region and the sequences have a distinct divergence point, the ZNF6 locus most likely represents a cloning artifact in which the p23 cDNA and the ZNF6 cDNA became ligated in a head-to-head manner, although the possibility of the ZNF6 representing a pseudogene has not been eliminated. Portions of the p23 coding sequence were recently submitted to GenBank (accession number T11431) as an expressed sequence tag isolated from human pancreatic islet. Comparisons of p23 sequence to protein sequences listed in the Swiss-Prot and NBRF-PIR data bases do not reveal any significant homologies to known proteins, indicating that p23 is a novel protein. p23 has been observed to be a phosphoprotein (4), and multiple conserved candidate phosphorylation sites are present, as detected by the GenBank Motifs (1) program. No other common structural motifs were detected. Tissue and species distribution of p23. Recombinant p23 was expressed in E. coli and used to prepare a series of monoclonal antibodies (see Materials and Methods).

The surf2 peptide corresponding to the 18 carboxyterminal amino acids effectively blocked the immune precipitation of p23 complexes by the JJ5 antibody (lane 8) but had no effect on the JJ3 antibody (lane 5). The surfl peptide (amino acids 60 to 75) had no effect on either JJ3 (lane 4) or JJ5 (lane 7). Positions of molecular mass markers are shown on the right. K, kilodalton.  JJ5 was used to screen various chicken and mammalian tissues to identify the tissue and species distribution of p23. Per gram of tissue, similar levels of p23 are seen in chicken oviduct, brain, spleen, and liver cytosols (Fig. SA). In a comparison of chicken oviduct cytosol versus crude chicken oviduct nuclear extract, the majority of p23 appears to be present in the cytosol, although there are detectable levels in the nuclear extract (data not shown). The JJ5 monoclonal antibody also cross-reacts with 23-kDa antigens in mouse liver, guinea pig liver, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and human HeLa cell extract (Fig. SA). Although JJ5 does not recognize a 23-kDa protein in S. cerevisiae (data not shown), two additional monoclonal antibodies, JJ6 and JJ1O, do recognize a 21 to 22-kDa protein in S. cerevisiae (Fig. SB). These studies clearly show that p23 is a protein with a broad tissue and species distribution. In addition, a panel of antibodies against p23, including the monoclonal antibodies JJ3, JJ5, and R3, were found not to share cross-reactivity with any proteins other than p23, suggesting that p23 is a unique protein. Immunoprecipitation of p23. Immunoprecipitations from chicken oviduct cytosol with two monoclonal antibodies against p23 are shown in Fig. 6. Upon immunoprecipitation with antibodies JJ3 and JJ5 against p23 (lanes 3 and 6, respectively), the pattern of bands is quite similar to that with PR22 immunoprecipitation (lane 2). The bands corresponding to the PR B and A forms, hsp90, and hsp70 have been confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Two peptides, surfl (DPNESKHKRTDRSILC) and surf2 (GADD DSPDSDDEKMPDLE), were prepared because their sequences were predicted to be highly antigenic. These peptides were tested for their ability to block the interaction of p23 with antibodies JJ3 and JJ5. The binding of antibody JJ5 but not antibody JJ3 to p23 complexes is inhibited by the peptide surf2, which corresponds to the carboxy-terminal 18 amino acids of p23 (Fig. 6, lane 8). In addition to inhibiting binding of p23 to the antibody, the surf2 peptide also specifically eliminates the copurification of hsp90, PR B and A, hsp70, and additional  proteins of lesser abundance: one migrating at approximately 200 kDa, a few proteins in the 35- to 40-kDa range, and two lower-molecular-mass proteins of about 15 kDa. The identities of the latter proteins are unknown. The surfl peptide does not have an effect on immunoprecipitation of p23 with either antibody. In Fig. 7, antibody JJ3 was used to immunoprecipitate p23 from mouse liver, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, chicken brain, spleen, liver, and oviduct. hsp90 and hsp70 specifically coprecipitate with p23 in each tissue tested, although the ratios of p23 to hsp90 and hsp70 vary depending on the tissue. A number of other proteins coprecipitate with p23 antibodies in various tissues, the most prominent being a 42-kDa protein seen precipitating from chick liver (lane 6). Only the bands corresponding to hsp90 and hsp70 have been identified by Western blot (data not shown). A similar pattern of immunoprecipitation was seen with the JJ5 antibody (data not shown). Reconstitution of p23 into PR complexes. Immunoaffinityisolated chicken PR that has been stripped of associated proteins in high salt will reassociate with rabbit hsp90, hsp70, and p23 when incubated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (31, 32). This is not a simple binding event but occurs through a temperature- and ATP-dependent process that is still unclear. Once reassembled, the addition of progesterone leads to activation of the PR, evident in the dissociation of hsp90 and p23 (31, 32). To demonstrate that the full-length cDNA clone Hp23C is sufficient to produce functional p23, we transcribed and translated the clone in vitro, producing [35S]methioninelabeled human p23. The translation mixture was then added to a standard chicken PR reconstitution (32), shown in Fig. 8. On the Coomassie blue-stained gel (lanes 1 to 5), lane 1 shows the proteins in the intact receptor complex isolated from chick oviduct cytosol, and lane 2 shows the isolated PR after treatment with 0.5 M KCl to remove hsp9o and p23.

Further treatment with progesterone to activate the PR leads to decreased recovery of both rabbit p23 in the stained gel and human p23 in the autoradiograph (lane 8). DISCUSSION In this report we have identified p23 as a novel, ubiquitous, and conserved protein that associates with unactivated PR complexes. Although p23 has only been studied in detail in relation to PR complexes, it may be a component of other steroid receptors complexes, as well as other complexes containing hsp9o. A 23-kDa protein associated with mouse L-cell glucocorticoid receptor (2) cross-reacts with the monoclonal antibody R3 (10), indicating that it is a related protein. The 22-kDa protein associated with bovine estrogen receptor (24) is a likely candidate for a p23 homolog, although this has not yet been tested. Recent studies with the unactivated human PR from T47D cells also show p23 copurifying with human PR (17). Despite these reports, p23 has not been recognized as a major component common to steroid receptor complexes, in part because of the lack of alternative methods for showing a relationship between p23 and steroid receptors. The demonstration that antibodies to p23 specifically coprecipitate the PR complements studies showing p23 copurifying with immunoprecipitated PR, providing further evidence that p23 is indeed a structural component of the PR complex. p23 is a highly conserved protein that has been found in every tissue tested to date. The high amino acid homology (96.3%) between chicken and human p23 equals that of hsp90, which shows 96% identity at the amino acid level between chicken and human forms (8). p23 is not one of the major heat shock proteins, and its sequence shows no relatedness to those of the family of 22- to 28-kDa heat shock proteins (15). Incubation of minced chick oviduct at 43°C for 1 h produces a substantial increase in the synthesis ([35S]methionine labeling)  ~  w= -43K -36K  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  _  -97K -68K -55K  lmim  w  _m4~mo  -36K  -29K  -21K  1962  JOHNSON ET AL.

The common identity of p23 in receptor complexes and in hsp90 complexes and the protein encoded by the cloned p23 cDNA was demonstrated by uniform recognition by monoclonal antibodies prepared against p23 from chick oviduct or from bacterially expressed protein. Also, p23 synthesized in vitro was able to bind to PR and to partially dissociate from the receptor complex upon progesterone treatment. hsp70 and hsp9o appear to bind directly to the PR (12, 28), but it is not known whether p54, p50, and p23 bind to the PR through hsp90 or hsp70 or whether they bind to the receptor itself. From the present work, it appears that most p23 in oviduct cytosol is bound to hsp90, suggesting that p23 is binding to the receptor in conjunction with hsp90. This does not rule out direct binding of p23 to the PR. While it seems likely that p23 is a common component of steroid receptors, this has not yet been established. The function of this protein is completely unknown. No clues are provided from its sequence, which lacks any identity to known proteins. The only common functional motifs present in p23 are multiple potential phosphorylation sites. Although p23 is readily labeled with 32p; in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (4), it has not yet been determined whether the phosphorylation state of p23 is important for binding to hsp90 or the PR. We have found that the simple treatment of extracts with phosphatase or phosphatase inhibitors does not affect the appearance of p23 in PR complexes (11). p23 appears to be structurally unrelated to the two major classes of proteins previously shown to bind steroid receptors, those being heat shock proteins (22, 34) and immunophilins (14, 23, 36, 39). However, the interaction of p23 with hsp90 and hsp70 observed in a variety of tissues suggests that its function relates to these two proteins that are believed to act as chaperones in the folding and processing of proteins (5, 7). In many tissues, p23 appears to be almost totally bound to hsp90. On the basis of immunodepletion studies in chick oviduct cytosol (data not shown), we estimate the concentration of p23 in the cytosol to be 5 to 7 ,ug/ml. By using estimated levels of receptor (1 ,ug/ml) and hsp90 (150 ,ug/ml), this allows the rough estimate for the molar ratio of PR/p23/hsp90 at 1:30: 175. The abundance of hsp90 relative to PR and p23 in the cytosol suggests that p23-associated hsp90 may define a subpopulation of hsp90 that may be directed toward a specialized function in which the proteins cooperate in the binding, folding, or processing of a protein substrate, such as steroid receptors.  assistance by Nancy McMahon and Bridget Stensgard is greatly appreciated.

Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  Clues as to the function of p23 might be gained by studies on the assembly of steroid receptor complexes. Complexes of the avian PR do not form simply by mixing the individual protein components. This appears to be an energy-driven process that requires ATP hydrolysis, hsp70, and additional factors that have not been identified (32). In a similar vein, we have recently found that the binding of p23 to hsp90 and hsp70 does not occur upon mixing these proteins together. However, these complexes can be disrupted and reformed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate through a process that is also dependent on ATP (11). Thus, parallels suggesting that the assembly of the p23 complex is a key step in the formation of PR complexes exist.

												<BodyText>.......  .. .....  ........  ......  ..... .......... ..........  ......  ...  ....§  Functional Participation of the IL-2 Receptor y Chain in IL-7 Receptor Complexes Motonari Kondo, Toshikazu Takeshita, Masaya Higuchi, Masataka Nakamura, Tetsuo Sudo, Shin-lchi Nishikawa, Kazuo Sugamura* The y chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor is shared with the functional IL-4 receptor and is causatively related to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), which is ascribed to a profound T cell defect. Studies with monoclonal antibodies specific for the IL-2 receptor y chain showed that the y chain participates in the functional high-affinity receptor complexes for IL-7 that are involved in the differentiation of T and B cells. Participation of the y subunit in more than one receptor may enable the elucidation of the mechanisms of XSCID development and lymphocyte differentiation. E r  CL 0 c 0  W,c  8 :5 0 c  B  E 10i  1.,  Cytokines mediating communication among cells in the immune system function through binding to specific receptors on target cells (1). Interleukin-2, a cytokine produced by T cells, interacts with the IL-2 receptor to induce T cell growth (2). The -y chain (3), in addition to the a and 0 chains, is essential for high-affinity IL-2 binding (4) and signal transduction (5). Mutations in the y chain gene are closely associated with XSCID, a major feature of which is complete depletion of T cells (6), which demonstrates the indispensable function of the y chain in T cell development. We produced monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the y chain of the mouse IL-2 receptor (7). When added to the culture of a mouse T cell line, CTLL-2, one of the mAbs [TUGm2; rat immunoglobin G2b (IgG2b)], which inhibits IL-2 binding to the high-affinity receptor, interfered with CTLL-2 cell growth that had been induced by IL-4, as well as growth induced by IL-2 (7). The other mAb (TUGm3; rat IgG2a), which does not interfere with IL-2 binding, detected the y chain cross-linked with IL-4 (7). These data established that the y chain is a shared component between the IL-2 and IL-4 receptors (7, 8). One may plausibly assume that the y chain plays the exclusive role in the development of T cells as a component of the receptor complex for either IL-2 or IL-4. This does not, however, seem to be the case, because IL-2- or IL-4-deficient mice were found to be normal in terms of numbers of T cell subsets in the periphery (9). During our exploration of cytokines that require the y chain as a component of their receptors, we found M. Kondo, T. Takeshita, M. Higuchi, M. Nakamura, K.

We examined the effect of TUGm2 on the ligand-induced growth of mouse spleen cells (Fig. 1A). Interleukin-7 induced [3Hjthymidine incorporation by spleen cells that were incubated with concanavalin A (Con A) in a concentration-dependent fashion. When TUGm2 was added, the [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to IL-7 was reduced. The inhibition effect was further examined with an IL-7-dependent pre-B cell line, IxN/2b (1 1). The IxN/2b cells also showed IL-7-dependent [3Hlthymidine incorporation that was inhibited by TUGm2 (Fig. 1B). The inhibition was most prominent at low concentrations of IL-7. Addition of a mAb, A7R34 (rat IgG2a), specific for the conventional IL-7 receptor (12) affected [3H]thymidine incorporation of IxN/2b cells at IL-7 concentrations lower than 5 x 1O-` M, which was indistinguishable from incorporation without IL-7. Simultaneous addition of TUGm2 and A7R34 completely blocked the incorporation at any IL-7 concentrations tested. A control mAb, REY-7 (rat IgG2b), specific for the human T cell leukemia virus-type 1 (HTLV-I) envelope protein gp46 (13), did not have any detectable effect. Thus, IL-7-dependent growth required the function of the y chain. To examine the possibility that the y chain participates in the IL-7 receptor complex, we investigated whether IL-7 binds directly to the y chain by the combination method of cross-linking and immunoprecipitation. The IxN/2b cells were incubated with 1251-labeled IL-7 and cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS). Cell lysates were precipitated with TUGm3, which does not inhibit ligand binding, and analyzed by electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The precipitate included a radiolabeled molecule of 90 to 110 kD, presumably consisting of the y chain and 1251-IL-7 (Fig. 2). SCIENCE *  5  0 0  10-12 10-11 10-10 10-9 10-8 IL-7 (M)  Fig. 1.

After washing, spleen cells (1 x 106) were further cultured for 72 hours with recombinant IL-7 (12). [3H]Thymidine (1 ,uCi) was added 6 hours before harvesting on glass filters. Radioactivity was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. (B) An IL-7-dependent mouse pre-B cell line, IxN/2b (1 x 104), was similarly cultured for 48 hours in complete medium without Con A. Cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine for 4 hours. Ascites mAbs at a 1:40 dilution were used: REY-7 (antibody to HTLV-I envelope protein gp46) (0), TUGm2 (antibody to mouse IL-2 receptor y chain) (@), A7R34 (antibody to mouse IL-7 receptor) (E), and TUGm2 + A7R34  (a).  VOL. 263  *  11 MARCH 1994  This molecule was not detected when TUGm2 or excess unlabeled IL-7 was added to the cells before cross-linking. This observation is similar to those shown previously with IL-2 and IL-4 binding to the y chain (7) and indicates that interaction between the y chain and IL-7 is possible, which suggests functional participation of the y chain in the IL-7 receptor complex. To gain insight into the effect of the y chain on IL-7 binding, we did Scatchard analysis (3). The binding of IL-7 was measured with IxN/2b cells in the presence of the mAbs. With no specific mAbs, or in the presence of the control mAb REY-7, IxN/2b cells had two-phase binding plots: a 1453  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on November 6, 2009  `. ..... -11,11 ............................  ,, ..j.,---------- 1251L  7 with the -y chain.

The immunoprecipitates were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (lane 1). In control experiments, diluted (1:10) TUGm2 ascites (lane 2) or 100 nM unlabeled IL-7 (lane 3) were added to the IxN/2b culture before addition of 1251-IL-7.

Addition of TUGm2 reduced the affinity of the highaffinity site from 79 to 255 pM without strongly affecting the number of sites, whereas no change in the low affinity was apparent. In contrast, the cells treated with mAb A7R34, which is specific for the conventional IL-7 receptor, displayed only the low-affinity receptor. Results from treatment of cells with A7R34 together with TUGm2 did not differ from those from treatment with A7R34 alone. These results indicate that the -y chain is necessary for formation of the high-affinity IL-7 receptor complexes. Two-phase plots were seen in IxN/2b cells even after the function of the y chain was blocked by TUGm2. The moderately high affinity was close to the pseudo-high affinity associated with the functionally inactive IL-2 receptor complex consisting of the IL-2 receptor a and P chains (4). Thus the moderately high-affinity IL-7 binding site may be a complex of at least two subunits: the conventional IL-7 receptor and an unidentified molecule. The low-affinity binding sites in the  presence of A7R34 may be attributable to the presence of this unidentified molecule, which may be the component of the moderately high-affinity IL-7 receptor complex. The molecule may also account for intrinsic IL-7 binding sites detected on COS-7 (14) and THP-1 (15) cells, which are negative for the y chain (4, 16). Exogenous expression of the conventional IL-7 receptor on COS-7 cells converted the low-affinity binding sites to the high-affinity binding sites (14)-presumably the moderately high-affinity binding sites. The y chain alone did not show any appreciable IL-7 binding (17). Our finding that the y chain of the IL-2 receptor is a functionally essential subunit for the IL-7 receptor may be a step toward better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to development of normal lymphocytes and that lead to XSCID. Because lack of either IL-2 or IL-4 does not induce the XSCID phenotype, it seems difficult to account for XSCID by impairment of the function of the y chain, which is used for the receptors for IL-2 and IL-4. In the context of involvement of y chain mutations in XSCID, the conventional IL-7 receptor is expressed on CD4-CD8- T lineage cells in the thymus (12), which also have the y chain on their surface (18).  Collectively, it may be that XSCID results from insufficient delivery of the IL-7 receptor-mediated signal as a result of the y chain mutation in very early T precursors. Nevertheless, mice given antibodies against IL-7 and the conventional IL-7 receptor display, apart from profoundly reduced populations of T cells, complete depletion of B cells in the periphery (12, 19), which is distinct from the phenotype of human XSCID. Participation of IL-7 in lymphocyte development may be different in mice and humans, or another cytokine or cytokines requiring the y chain as a receptor component may cause XSCID. The conclusion that the -y chain is involved in the IL-7 receptor complexes has been independently shown (20). REFERENCES AND NOTES  </BodyText></FullTextData>

														<Abstract>The ultraviolet (UV) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by AP-1 and NF-kappa B. The effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of JNK1, a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response. Significantly, Ha-Ras partially activates JNK1 and potentiates the activation caused by UV. JNK1 binds to the c-Jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNK1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNK1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.</Abstract>

In contrast, SIF activity is regulated by a different signaling pathway in which DNA binding and nuclear translocation are induced by phosphorylation caused by receptor Tyr kinases and the JAK group of receptor-linked Tyr kinases (reviewed by Hunter, 1993). While c-jun transcription is rapidly induced by many stimuli, its pattern of expression is not identical to c-fos (Brenner et al., 1989; Devary et al., 1991). For example, ultraviolet (UV) light is a very potent inducer of c-jun transcription, but this treatment only modestly induces expression of c-fos (Devary et al., 1991). The induction of c-juh by UV is mediated by a divergent AP-1 binding site (phorbol ester [TPA] response element) in its promoter (Angel et al., 1988) that is recognized by either cJun homodimers (Angel et al., 1988; Deng and Karin, 1993) or cJun/ATF-2 heterodimers (van Dam et al., 1993). The activity of both complexes is stimulated by the phosphorylation of cJun (Binetruy et al., 1991; Devary et al., 1992; Pulverer et al., 1991; Smeal et al., 1991,1992) and possibly ATF-2 (AbdelHafiz et al., 1992; P. Herrlich, personal communication). The transcriptional activity of cJun is greatly enhanced in response to phosphorylation of two similarly situated Ser residues, Ser-63 and Ser-73, within its transactivation domain (Pulverer et al., 1991; Smeal et al., 1991, 1992). In response to UV irradiation, these sites are rapidly phosphorylated, resulting in enhanced cJun transcriptional activity and induction of AP-1 target genes, including c-jun itself (Devary et al., 1992; Radler-Pohl et al., 1993). Phosphorylation of both residues is also increased in response to activation of receptor Tyr kinases, Src family Tyr kinases, and Ha-Ras (Binetruy et al., 1991; Smeal et al., 1991, 1992). Recently, a novel protein kinase activity, cJun NHr terminal kinase (JNK), was identified that binds to the cJun transactivation domain and phosphorylates Ser-63, Ser-73, and some secondary sites (Hibi et al., 1993). Biochemical characterization identified 46 kd and 55 kd polypeptides exhibiting JNK activity (Hibi et al., 1993). Although similarly regulated, the 46 kd polypeptide exhibits a higher affinity for binding tocJun than the 55 kd polypep tide (Hibi et al.,.1993). The activity of both forms of JNK (JNK46 and JNK-55) is rapidly and potently stimulated by UV irradiation (Devaty et al., 1993; Hibi et al., 1993). A lower level of JNK activation was observed in cells expressing oncogenic Ha-Ras (Hibi et al., 1993). As UV is a potent tumor-promoting agent, a protein kinase such as JNK that is activated in UV-irradiated cells may play a major role during tumor promotion (Devary et al., 1992). The sites, phosphorylated on cJun by JNK, consist of a Ser residue, followed by Pro and an acidic residue (Hibi et al., 1993). This observation identifies JNK as a member of the Pro-directed kinase group that includes the MAP kinases and the cyclindependent protein kinases (Davis, 1993). The activity of the mammalian MAP kinases ERKl and ERK2 is rapidly stimulated in response to the engage ment of several cell surface receptors (Cobb et al., 1991;  Summary The ultraviolet (UV) reaponee of mammalian cells is charactarlxed by a rapid and eelectlve Increaee In gene expreeelon medlated by AP-1 and NF-KB.

Significantly, Ha-Raa partially actlvatee JNKl and potentiatea the activation caueed by UV. JNKl binds to the c&amp;n traneactlvation domaln and phoephorylatea It on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNKl la a component of a novel signal tmnaduction pathway that la activated by oncoprotelna and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNKl activation may play an important role in tumor promotion. Introduction The activity of transcription factor AP-1 is rapidly elevated in response to a large number of environmental stimuli (Angel and Karin, 1991). Part of this regulation is due to rapid induction of fos andjun gene transcription. However, another important level of control is the posttranslational modification of both preexisting and newly synthesized Jun and Fos proteins (Binetruy et al., 1991; Boyle et al., 1991; Pulverer et al., 1991; Smeal et al., 1991, 1992). Transcriptional activation of the c-fos gene is exerted through two major cis elements: the serum response efement (SRE) that is recognized by a heterodimer of serum response factor (SRF)-ternary complex factor (TCF) (Treisman, 1992) and the c&amp;s inducible element (SIE) that binds to the c-s/s inducible factor (SIF) (Sadowski and Gilman, 1993). The activity of TCF (Elk-l) is rapidly increased in response to cell stimulation with various agents, such as growth factors, that lead to mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase activation. Extracellular signal-regulated MAP kinases 1 (ERKl) and 2 (ERK2) appear to be responsible for the phosphorylation of TCF on  Cdl 1026  -- PKAu ERKZ  1 I  ,-- __  i  ERKl  KSSl SPKI  JNKl GSK3  I  II  IIT  Figure 1.

(C)Comparison of JNKl with other protein kinases. The comparison was created by the PILEUP program using a progressive pair-wise alignment and is shown as a dendrogram. The identity of the kinases with JNKl was calculated with the BESTFIT program: ERKl (3g.7%). ERW (43.1%) HOG1 (41 .l%). FUS3 (41.5%) KSSl (40.6%) MPKl (41 .o%), SPKl (40.1%), CDCP (37.5%), GSK-3a (29.7%), protein kinase Aa (21.5%). and protein kinase Ca (22.6%). The similarity of the kinases to JNKI was calculated wfth the SESTFIT program: ERKl (64.5%). ERK2 (67.6%) HOG1 (54.2%), FUS3 (53.946) KSSl (53.9%) MPKI (53.7%), SPKl (63.5%), CDCP (53.7%). GSK-3e (51X6%), protein kinase Aa (45.8%). and protein klnase Ca (44.2%). The PILEUP and BESTFIT programs were from the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group.  Sturgill and Wu, 1991). This stimulation is due to the activation of the dual-specificity protein kinase MAP kinase kinase (MEK) (Crews et al., 1992) that phosphorylates ERKl and EM2 at two sites within the motif Thr-GluTyr (Ahn et al., 1992). Here, we describe the novel protein kinase, JNKl , that is a distant relative of the MAP kinase group of signal transducing enzymes. We show that JNKl  is activated rapidly and potently in response to UV irradiation, binds to the NH&amp;erminal transactivation domain of cJun, and phosphorylates it specifically on M-63 and Ser-73. The size and biochemical properties of the molecularly cloned JNKl protein kinase indicate that it corresponds to the previously characterized JNK-46 activity.

However, the dual phosphorylation site motif present in JNKl (Thr*-Pro-Tyr') is distinct from that located within ERKs (Thr*-Glu-Tyr"). tion  Results JNKl Is a Distant Relative of the MAP Klnase Group ot Slgnal-Transducing Enzymes To identify novel members of the MAP kinase group, we employed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy using degenerate primers to amplify sequences from a human liver cDNA library (see Experimental Procedures for details). Sequence analysis of PCR products led to identification of one cDNA fragment that exhibited homology to known MAP kinases. This cDNA fragment was used to screen a human fetal brain library to isolate a full-length clone. The sequence of the largest clone obtained is presented in Figure 1. A single long open reading frame that encodes a putative protein kinase, JNKl , with a predicted mass of 44.2 kd was identified. In-frame stop codons in the 5' and 3' regions of the cDNA indicate that this clone contains the entire JNKl coding region. Comparison of the deduced structure of JNKl with the GenBank data base (Blast Fileserver, National Center for Biotechnology Information) revealed homology to the MAP kinases ERKl (Boulton et al., 1990) and ERK2 (Boulton et al., 1991). Sequence homology was also observed between JNKl and the yeast MAP kinases HOG1 (Brewster et al., 1993), MPKl (Torres et al., 1991; Lee et al., 1993)  FUS3 (Elion et al., 1990), and KSSl (Courchesne et al., 1989). Significant regions of identity between JNKl and other MAP kinases are found throughout the protein klnase domain. Notably, the Thr and Tyr phosphorylation sites, located in subdomain VIII, which are required for MAP kinase activation (Payne et al., 1991), are consenred in JNKl. Together, these sequence similarities indicate that JNKl is a distant relative of the MAP kinase group (Figure 1C). To examine the tissue distribution of JNKl , we investigated by Northern blot analysis the level of JNK7 mRNA. A single major JNK7 transcript (3.5 kb) was observed in fetal brain tissue (Figure 2A). In adult tissues, there was an ubiquitous expression of transcripts that hybridized to the JNK7 probe. However, a tissue-specific heterogeneity of the mRNA was observed in adult tissues (Figure 28). This heterogeneity could result from alternative processing of transcripts from a single gene. Alternatively, it is possible that JNKl represents the prototype for a sub family of closely related protein kinases. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that multiple bands hybridized to a JNK7 probe during Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA (Figure X). However, the Southern hybridization data could also be accounted for by the intron/exon structure of the JNK7 gene. A definitive demonstration of the expression of JNKl-related protein kinases will require the molecular cloning of these enzymes. In the present study, JNK7 accounted for all the cDNAclones isolated from the human fetal brain cDNA library.

After 49 hr, the cells were exposed to different doses of UV-C and then incubated for 1 hr at 37%. JNKI was isolated by immunoprecipitation with the M2 monoclonal antibody, and JNKI activity was measured using an immune complex kinase assay with the substrate GST-cJun(l-79).  JNKl Is Actlvatad during the UV Raaponss To characterize the kinase activity of purified JNI&amp;lt;l , we constructed an expression vector encoding an epitopetagged JNKl protein that could be immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody. JNKl protein kinase activity was detected in the immune complex. In initial studies designed to characterize JNKl activity, we employed SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and an in-gel kinase assay to identify the apparent mass of the JNKl protein kinase. Essentially identical results were obtained using standard immune complex kinase assays (data not shown). Autophosphorylation of JNKI was not observed in experiments performed in the absence of an exogenous substrate. However, a low level of kinase activity migrating at 46 kd was detected when a recombinant fragment of the cJun activation domain (glutathione S-transferase [GSTj-cJun[l-791) was used as a substrate (Figure 3A). Treatment of the transfected cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or phorbol ester (TPA) caused a low level of JNKl activation that was sustained for approximately2 hr (Figure3B). In contrast, exposure to UV radiation caused a marked increase in JNKl activity. Significantly, the electrophoretic mobility of the UV-stimulated JNKl enzymatic activity is similar to JNK46 (Hibi et al., 1993). The slightly slower mobility of JNKl compared with JNK46 is most likely caused by the octapeptide epitope-tag fused to JNKl (data not shown). The  UV-induced activation of JNKl occurred rapidly after UV irradiation, with maximal activation at 1 hr followed by a progressive decline in JNKl activity at later times (Figure 3C). Examination of the UV dose response revealed detectable JNKl activation at 20 J/m2 and maximal activation at approximately 60 J/m* (Figure 3D). Significantly, the time course and dose response of JNKl activation by UV (Figure 3) was similar to the regulation of the endogenous JNK-46 protein kinase expressed by COS cells (Figure 4). The electrophoretic mobility of JNKl, its potent activation by UV, the lack of detectable autophosphorylation, and the efficient phosphorylation of GST-cJun fusion proteins suggest that JNKl is homologous or identical to the protein kinase activity JNK-46 that has been identified in UV-irradiated cells (Hibi et al., 1993). Ha-Ras Activates JNKl and Potentlates the UV Response Pathway The results of previous studies have shown that oncogenically activated Ras stimulates the NH=terminal phosphorylation of cJun (Binetruy et al., 1991; Smeal et al., 1991, 1992). In addition, Ras is involved in the UV response leading to increased cJun activity (Devary et al., 1992; Radler-Pohl et al., 1993). Therefore, we investigated the  Cdl 1030  Figure  6. Substrate  Specificity  of JNKl  (A) Epitcpe-tagged JNKl was expressed in COS cellsandactivetedbyexposuretoUVlight. JNKI was Mated by immunoprecipttation with the M2 monoctonal antibody and used to phosphorytate 3 ug of GST (control, lane l), GST-cJun(l-223) (lane 2) GST-cJun(43223) (lane 3) GST-cJun(l-7a) (lane 4) GST-c-Jun(l-22Wta-63, Ala-73) (tane 5), GST-chicken cJun (chcJun) (l144) (lane S), GSTchicken vJun (chvJun) (l144) (lane 7), or myelin basic protein (MBP) (lane 8).

Significantly, expression of activated Ha-Ras potentiated UVstimulated JNKl activity (Figure 5). By itself, Ha-&amp;s caused JNKl activation that was approximately 49% of that obtained with 40 J/m* UV irradiation. These data indicate that Ha-FM partially activates JNKl and that Ha-Ras potentiates the activation caused by UV. Further studies will be required to determine the signaling pathway and mechanism by which Ha-&amp;s regulates JNKl activity. JNKl Phosphofylatee c&amp;n et Ser-63 and Ser-73 To investigate the relationship between JNKl and JNK-46, the substrate specificity of JNKl was examined. Figure 6A shows that both GST-vJun and myelin basic protein are very poor substrates for JNKl , while GST-cJun fusion proteins are excellent JNKl substrates. This pattern of substrate specificity is identical to JNK-46 purified from UV-irradiated HeLa cells (Figure 6s). Like JNK46, JNKl efficiently phosphorylated GST-cJun fusion proteins containing residues l-223 and l-79 of cJun. However, a deletion of cJun NH&amp;erminal sequences, including the S domain (residues 31-57), caused a marked decrease in phosphorylation by JNKl . Replacement of Ser-63 and Ser-73 with Ala also decreased the obsewed phosphorylation. On the other hand, the substrate specificity of the MAP kinases ERKl and ERK2 was markedly different from that of JNKl (Figure SC). In this case, myelin basic protein was a significantly better substrate than GST-cJun. In addition, there was no discrimination among GST-cJun, GST-vJun, and the mutants lacking JNK phosphorylation sites (GST-cJun[Ala]) or the JNK-binding site (GST-cJun[43-223)). To establish further the substrate specificity of JNKl , we determined the sites of cJun phosphorylation by phosphopeptide mapping. The major phosphopeptldes observed wereX and Y (Figure 7). These phosphopeptides were also found in maps of cJun phosphorylated by purified JNK-46. In previous studies, these phosphopeptides were shown to correspond to the phosphorylation of the regulatory sites Ser-63 and M-73 (Binetruy et al., 1991;  Pulverer et al., 1991; Smeal et al., 1991, 1992). Examination of the primary sequence surrounding these phosphorylation sites indicates the consensus sequence motif Leul Ala-Ser.-Pro-Asp/Glu. A low level phosphorylation of sites other than Ser-63 and M-73 was also observed and was not affected by substitution of Ser-63 and Ser-73 with Ala (phosphopeptides Tl and T2). These sites correspond to phosphorylation at Thr-Pro motifs (Thr-91, Thr-93, or Thr-95) that were previously identified as minor JNK sites (Hibi et al., 1993). Importantly, no phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal sites (Boyle et al., 1991; Lin et al., 1992), including W-243, which is phosphorylated by purified ERKs (Alvarez et al., 1991) was observed. The low level of COOH-terminal phosphorylation previously observed with partially purified JNK preparations (Hibi et al., 1993) is most likely due to contamination with other protein kinases. JNKI Aosoclates with the c&amp;n Tmnsectlvatlon Domain The observation that vJun is not a good JNKl substrate is intriguing because both vJun and cJun contain the phosphoacceptor sites Ser-63 and W-73. This suggests that the presence of the primary sequence encoding a phosphorylation site may be insufficient for efficient substrate recognition by JNKl . In previous studies, a small region of the cJun transactivation domain, the 6 subdomain (Vogt and Bos, 1996) was proposed to mediate the direct interaction of cJun with a physiologically relevant protein kinase that phosphorylates Ser-63 and Ser-73 (Adler et al., 1992; Hibi et al., 1993) and was identified as a binding site for JNK (Hibi et al., 1993). According to this hypothesis, the inefficient phosphorylatiin of vJun is due to defective JNK binding (Hibi et al., 1993). To investigate whether JNKl is a physiologically relevant cJun protein kinase, we examined the binding of immunopurified JNKl isolated from UV-stimulated COS cells. The binding of JNKl to cJun was detected using a solid-phase kinase assay in which JNK binds to an immobilized GST-cJun fusion protein and, after the addition  c&amp;n 1031  NHrTerminal  Kinaee  GSTcJun(l-223)  GSl `cJun(l-223/Ala-63,73)  GSTcJun(l-79) `I .:  Figure 7.

Full-length c&amp;n wae aleo phoephorylated by JNK-48 purified from UV-irradiated HeLa cells. The phoepholylated proteins were isolated by SDSPAGE, eluted from the gel, and digested with trypsin. The tryptic digests were separated by thin layer electrophoresis (horizontal dimension) followed by ascending chromatography (vertical dimension) and were visualized by autoradiography. The origin and the phosphopeptidee X, Y, Ti, and T2 are indicated.  A c-Jun +JNKl c-Jun +JNK46  of ATP, phosphorylates Ser-83 and Ser-73 (Hibi et al., 1993). Deletion of residues l-42 or l-55 of the cJun transactivation domain, which includes the 8 subdomain, prevented binding of JNKl (Figure 8A). Deletion of cJun residues l-32 reduced, but did not eliminate, JNKl binding. However, deletion of residues l-22 had no effect on JNKl binding. Previous studies have demonstrated that the effect of these deletions on GST-cJun phosphorylation is due to changes in JNKl binding rather than the presentation of the phosphoacceptor sites (Hibi et al., 1993). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that a region of thecJun NHrterminusadjacent to the major phosphorylation sites (Ser-83 and Ser-73) is required for binding to JNKl. To examine whether the binding of JNKl to cJun was altered by the state of JNKl activation, we examined by Western blotting the binding of epitope-tagged JNKl to immobilized cJun. It was obsenred that JNKl from either unstimulated or UV-irradiated cells bound to GST-cJun (Figure 8B). These data demonstrate that JNKl binds to a specific region (residues 23-79) of the NH&amp;erminal transactivation domain of cJun. This binding probably reflects the direct interaction of JNKl with cJun. However, these experiments do not exclude the possibility that an accessory protein is required for JNKl binding to cJun or that an accessory protein may stabilize this interaction.  Phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr Is Required for UV-Induced JNKl Activation MAP kinases are activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr residues within subdomain VIII (see Figure 1). Therefore, we tested whether phosphorylation at these sites is required for JNKl activation by UV. The predicted phosphorylation sites Thr-183 and Tyr-185 were replaced by Ala and Phe, respectively, using site-directed mutagenesis. A similar level of expression of the wild-type and mutated JNKl proteins was obtained in transiently transfected COS cells (Figure 9A). We examined JNKl phosphorylation using cells metabolically labeled with [32P]phosphate. Figure 96 shows that UV treatment caused increased phosphorylation of wild-type JNKl . Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated a high level of basal Ser phosphorylation of JNKl (Figure SC). The UV-stimulated phosphorylation of JNKl was accounted for by increased pP]phosphothreonine and ["Plphosphotyrosine (Figure 9C). Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping demonstrated that this dual phosphorylation was associated with the appearance of one major [32P]phosphopeptide (Figure 10). The presence of this novel phosphopeptide is consistent with the identification of Thr-183 and Tyr-185 as the sites of UV-stimulated phosphorylation of JNKl . This hypothesis was confirmed by demonstrating that mutations at Thr-183 and Tyr-185 blocked the UV-stimulated phosphorylation of JNKl (see  Cdl 1032  Discussion The oncogenic activity of cJun in rat embryo fibroblasts requires the NH&amp;erminal activation domain and is potentiated markedly by Ha-Ras (Alani et al., 1991). This oncogenie cooperation is mediated by phosphorylation of cJun at Ser-63 and Ser-73, resulting in enhanced transcriptional activity (Binetruy et al., 1991; Smeal et al., 1991, 1992). A significant question, therefore, concerns the identity of the kinase that phosphorylates cJun at these sites. Pul: verer et al. (1991, 1993) have proposed that ERKs may account for the phosphorylation of cJun at Ser-63 and Ser-73. However, others have found that the major site phosphorylated by ERKs is Ser-243, which is localized at the COOH-terminus of cJun (Alvarez et al., 1991; Baker et al., 1992; Chou et al., 1992; Davis, 1993; Minden et al., submitted). Most importantly, it was found that the NHrterminal phosphorylation of cJun does not correlate with activation of ERKl and ERK2 (Minden et al., submitted). Therefore, it is unlikely that ERKs can account for the phosphorylation of cJun at Ser-63 and Ser-73 in vivo. Recently, Hibi et al. (1993) identified a novel protein kinase activity, JNK, that binds and phosphorylates cJun at the NHrterminal sites. Two different polypeptides, 46 kd and 55 kd, were found to exhibit JNK activity (Hibi et al., 1993). Of the two, the 46 kd polypeptide JNK46 appears to bind cJun more efficiently (Hibi et al., 1993). This report describes the molecular characterization of JNKl, a novel protein kinase that, by several criteria, corresponds to JNK46. JNKl Is a Novel Protein KinThat lo Activated by Thr and Tyr Phoaphorylatlon We have molecularly cloned a novel protein kinase, JNKl , that is activated by UV irradiation, Ha-Ras, and growth factors. Sequence comparison using the GenBank data base reveals significant homology between JNKl and several members of the MAP kinase group. One characteristic of MAP kinases is that their activation is mediated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr within subdomain VIII (Cobb et al., 1991; Ahn et al., 1992; Davis, 1993). Significantly, these Thr and Tyr residues are conserved in JNKl (Figure 1) and mutations at these residues blocked UVinduced phosphotylation and activation (Figure 9). Thus, similar to ERKs, JNKl requires phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr for activation. In previous studies, we did not detect phosphotyrosine in partially purified JNK preparations using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Hibi et al., 1993). Similarly, the cloned JNKl protein kinase did not bind to several antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. As direct biochemical analysis demonstrates the presence of phosphotyrosine (Figure 9C), we conclude that the Tyr-phosphotylated JNKl protein kinase lacks the epitope that is recognized by many anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. This observation provides additional evidence that caution should ba employed in the interpretation of data obtained in experiments using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies.

Figure 9C). Significantly, these mutated JNKl proteins did not exhibit kinase activity when isolated from either unstimulated or UV-irradiated cells (see Figure 9D). Together, these data demonstrate that the mechanism of JNKl activation involves increased phosphorylation at Thr-163 and Tyr-166.  cJun N&amp;Terminsl 1099  Kinase  JNKl - UV  JNKl + UV   116-kDa  97-kDa 67-kDa 45kDa  f  116-kDa  97-kDa 67-kDa   45-kDa  Figure  10.

Expression of oncogenitally activated Ha-Ras efficiently stimulated JNKl, but not as potently as UV'irradiation (Figure 5). This pattern of regulation is distinctly different from that of ERKl and ERK2 (Minden et al., submitted). However, the activation by Ras and the presence of the consewed Thr and Tyr residues in subdomain VIII suggest certain similarities between the mechanisms of activation of ERK and JNK. Despite these similarities, there are also significant differences. While EGF, TPA, and activated Ras cause maximal ERK activation (Cobb et al., 1991; Sturgill and Wu, 1991; Davis, 1993) some of these agents caused only a small increase in JNKl activity. Conversely, UV irradiation caused marked JNKl activation, but only a small increase in ERK activity (Devary et al., 1993; Hibi et al., 1993; Radler-Pohl et al., 1993; Minden et al., submitted). Together, these considerations suggest that the mechanism of JNKl activation is distinct from the signaling pathway that leads to ERK activation. Further work is needed to determine the exact relationship between the UV- and  *  45-kDa  Figure 9.

Cell 1034  Ras-activated pathways leading to JNKl activation as well as their relationship to the ERK activation pathway. The MAP kinases ERKl and ERK2 are activated by phosphorylation atThrandTyrby MEK(Crewset al., 1992; Ahn et al., 1992). So far, we have not observed JNKl phosphorylation by MEK, although in parallel experiments MEK efficiently phosphorylated ERK2 (B. D., unpublished data). This finding provides further evidence suggesting that different pathways lead to JNKl and ERK activation. Most likely, JNKl is activated by a dual-specificity kinase that is distinct from MEK. Precedence for the existence of separate protein kinase signaling cascades is provided by genetic studies of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which KSSlIFUS3 are activated bySTE7, MPKl is activated by MKKVMKK2, and HOG1 is activated by PBS2 (Brewster et al., 1993; Courchesne et al., 1989; Elion et al., 1999; Lee et al., 1993). Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA with a JNK7 probe indicates the presence of multiple bands (Figure 2C). These hybridization signals could be derived from a single JNK7 gene. Alternatively, it is possible that a subfamily of JNKl-related protein kinases may exist. Additional members of this subfamily could include the 55 kd kinase JNK-55 (Hibi et al., 1993) and the ~54 MAP kinase purified by Kyriakis and colleagues (Kyriakis and Avruch, 1999; Kyriakis et al., 1991). In the case of the ~54 MAP kinase, it has been shown that both Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphatases inhibit kinase activity (Kyriakis et al., 1991). Thus, like JNKl, the ~54 MAP kinase may also be activated by dual phosphorylation at Thrand Tyr. Significantly, the ~54 MAP kinase has been shown to phosphorylate the NH&amp;erminal phosphoacceptor sitesof cJun (Pulverer et al., 1991). Together, the phosphorylation of cJun and the requirement for dual phosphorylation suggest that the ~54 MAP kinase may be a JNKl homolog and that it may be related to JNK-55. Despite these similarities, there are also significant differences between the regulatory properties of JNKl and the ~54 MAP kinase. For example, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide is a potent activator of the ~54 MAP kinase (Kyriakis and Avruch, 1990) but this drug was found to cause no significant change in JNKl activity (B. D., unpublished data). In addition, polylysine, which potentiates the phosphorylation of MAP2 by ~54 MAP kinase(Kyriakis and Avruch, 1999), had no effect on the phosphorylation of this substrate by JNK (Hibi et al., 1993). Further studies based on cDNA cloning are required to define the exact relationship between JNKl and other protein kinase activities that have been identified. Comparison of JNKl with the sequence of MAP kinases (Figure 1) demonstrates that it is similar to HOGl, a S. cerevisiae protein kinase, that is activated by osmotic stress (Brewster et al., 1993). Since the most potent activator of JNKl , UV irradiation, is also a form of environmental stress, it is possible that both JNKl and HOG1 have evolved from a common progenitor whose function was to transduce various signals elicited by environmental stress. The ~54 MAP kinase, activated by cycloheximide (Kyriakis and Avruch, 1990), represents another example  of a potential member of this sub group that responds to environmental stress. As JNKl is efficiently activated in response to UV irradiation, a significant question concerns the mechanism that triggers JNKl activation. The UV response in mammalian cells consists of two distinct signal transduction pathways. It was originally proposed that DNA damage may provide a signal that leads to the induction of UV-responsive genes (Karin and Herrlich, 1989; Holbrook and Fornace, 1991; Herrlich et al., 1992). However, recent studies demonstrated an additional UV-induced signal transduction pathway that is initiated in an extranuclear compartment (Devary et al., 1992; Radler-Pohl et al., 1993). The most persuasive evidence for the existence of this signaling pathway was obtained using enucleated cells which retain the UV activation of JNK (Devary et al., 1993). However, the mechanism by which UV initiates this signaling pathway is unclear. Interestingly, the effects of oxidative stress are very similar to the UV response of mammalian cells (Cerutti, 1985; Cerutti and Trump, 1991; Trush and Kensler, 1991; Devary et al., 1992). As exposure to UV may cause lipid peroxidation (Black, 1987) and consequently may decrease the level of reduced glutathione in cells (Lautier et al., 1992) it is possible that oxidative stress may initiate the UV response (Devary et al., 1992). An important question is, therefore, the identity of the redox sensor that triggers the signaling pathway. The molecular cloning of JNKl should facilitate the dissection of the signaling cascade that is triggered by UV irradiation.  Slgnlflcance of JNKl for the Regulation of c&amp;n Actlvlty The substrate specificity of JNKl results from the presence of both an association domain within the substrate and an appropriate primary sequence motif at the site of phosphorylation. At present only two JNKl phosphoacceptor sites have been identified (Ser.83 and Ser-73 of cJun). Therefore, it is premature to propose a primary sequence consensus for substrate phosphorylation, but it is interesting to note that the primary sequence surrounding both sites is very similar: Leu/Ala-Ser'-ProAsp/Glu. This sequence indicates that JNKl is a Prodirected protein kinase. However, the substrate specificity of JNKl (Figure 8) is distinct from that of ERKl and ERK2 (Alvarez et al., 1991; Gonzalez et al., 1991; Davis, 1993). Deletion mapping has identified the JNKl-binding site to be contained within amino acids 23-79 of the cJun activation domain. Thus, deletion of residues l-42 or l-55 prevents cJun binding to JNKl, while deletion of residues l-32 resulted in reduced JNKl binding, and the deletion of residues l-22 had no effect on JNKl binding (Figure 8). Importantly, the loss of this binding interaction is associated with a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of cJun by JNKl (Figure 8). The physiological significance of this finding is established by the obsenration that the UV- and Ras-induced transcriptional activity of cJun is compromised by deletion of the JNKl-binding site (Hibi et al., 1993). Thus, JNKl represents a physiologically rele PJ  NHrTerminal  Kinase  vant  protein kinase that phosphorylates the cJun activation domain. The requirement for an association domain within the substrate suggests a mechanism for targeting JNKl to physiologically important substrates. Precedence for protein association as an important targeting mechanism during signal transduction is provided by studies of Src homology domains (Pawson and Gish, 1992). The binding of substrates to JNKl is, therefore, likely to be physiologically significant. It is possible that all physiologically important JNKl substrates may contain an association domain. Alternatively, it is possible that the binding of JNKl to one substrate may serve to promote the phosphorylation of other proteins present in the same complex. Thus, the binding of JNKl to cJun may result in phosphorylation of proteins bound to cJun, such as c-Fos, ATF-2, and NF-AT (Hunter and Karin, 1992). It is also possible that the binding to cJun could serve to target JNKl to phosphorylate proteins that bind to adjacent c&amp;acting elements. Since cJun and closely related Jun proteins are the only known substrates for JNKl , an understanding of the complete physiological role of this protein kinase awaits further studies. However, in view of its efficient activation in response to UV irradiation, it is likely that JNKl and closely related enzymes play a unique role in cellular physiology. An important consideration is that UV irradiation is a potent tumor promoter (Weinstein, 1999; Romerdahl et al., 1999). So far, the molecular mechanisms mediating the tumor-promoting activity of UV are not understood. As JNKl is involved in the potentiation of AP-1 activity and is activated by Ha-Ras, JNKl represents an attractive candidate mediator of UV-induced tumor promotion. Expsrlmental Procedures  The plasmid pCMV-Ras/LeuGl was provided by Dr. L. Kozma (University of Massachusetts Medical School). The plasmids encoding GST-Jun fusion proteins were described previously (Hibi et al., 1993). Hybrtdlzatlon Anslysls Northern blots were performed using 2 pg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from different human tissues, fractionated by denaturing agarose gel elactrophoresis, and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Clontech). The blots were hybridized to a probe that was prepared by labeling the JNK7 cDNA with [a-=P]dCTP (Amersham International PLC) by random priming (Stratagene, Incorporated). The integrity of the mRNA samples was confirmed by hybridization to an actin probe. Southern blot analysis was performed using 10 pg of human genomic DNA that was digested with diierent restriction enzymes, fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto a nylon membrane. The membrane was probed with a random-primed fragment of JNKl cDNA (797-1275 bp). The blots were washed three times with 1 x SSC, 0.05% SDS, and 1 mM EDTA prior to autoradiography. Cell Lsbellng snd Transtactlons COSI cells were maintalned in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin (GIBCC-BRL). Metabolic labeling with $P]phosphate was performed by incubation of cells in phosphatefree modified Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories, incorporated) supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum and 1 mCi/ml plpjorthophosphate (DupoMNEN). Plasmid DNA(l pg)wastransfected into COSl cells using the lipofectamine method (GIBCO-BRL). After 49 hr. the cells were treated without and with TPA, EGF, or UVC. Immunopreclpltatlon and Wsstem Blot Analysis Metabolically labeled cells were lysed in 25 mM HEPES @H 7.5) 1% Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5 M NaCI, 50 mM NaF. 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM EDTA, 10 &amp;ml leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF. Soluble extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 100,090 x g for 30 min at 4OC. The extracts were precleared using protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia-LKB Biotechniologies, Incorporated) and then incubated with the monoclonal antibody M2 (IBI-Kodak) prebound to protein G-Sepharose. The M2 antibody recognizes the epitope Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (Flag; lmmunex Corporation) and immunoprecipitates the epitope-tagged JNKl protein. (In some experiments the rnonoclonal antibody 1206 was used to immunoprecipitate JNKl tagged with the HA epitope.) After 1 hr of incubation, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with 25 mM HEPES @H 7.5). 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA. Prior to analysis by Western blotting, protein samples were resolved by SDSPAGE and electroblotted onto lmmobilon P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were probed with the monoclonai antibody M2 (IBI-Kodak) and immune complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham International PLC). Protein Purltlcatlon GST-fusion proteins were purifled by affinity chromatography on GSH-agarose asdescribed (Smith and Johnson, 1999). Purified MAP kinase (a mixture of ERKl and ERK2) was obtained from Dr. M. Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern). JNK-46 was purified from UVirradiated HeLa 53 cells by standard liquid chromatography (M. H. et al., unpublished data). Epitopetagged JNKl wasimmunopurifiifrom transiently transfected COS cells. In brief, COScells were solubiltted with 20 mM Tris @H 7.6) 0.5% NP40.250 mM NaCI, 3 mM 5-g@ero phosphate, 3 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA, IOg pM sodium orthovanadate, 10 pg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF. JNKl was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using the M2 monoclonal antibody bound to protein A-Bepharose. The beads were washed extenaivaly with buffer A (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.7), 50 mM NaCI, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.06% Trtton X-l 00). JNKI was eluted from the column with 3 M urea in buffer A and then dialyzed against buffer A with 10% glycerol. Blndlng of JNKI to ths c-Jun Tmnsacthfatlon Domaln COS cells expressing epitopetagged JNKI were lysed in buffer A and a solubfe extract was obtained after centrifugatfon at 100,009 xg for 20 min. CCS cell extracts (250 Pg) were incubated with 20 pg of  cDNA Cloning Degenerate oligonucleotides (CAYMGNGAYNTNAARCC and GAGAGCCCATNSWCCADATRTC) were designed based on conserved kinase subdomains and employed as PCR primers to isolate fragments of MAP kinase-related cDNAs from a human liver cDNA library. Comparison of the sequence of 397 clones with the GenBank data base (Blast Fileserver, National Center for Biotechnology information) allowed identification of one clone that exhibited a high level of homology with members of the MAP kinase family. This partial cDNA was used to screen a ZAPII human fetal brain cDNA library (Stratagene, Incorporated). Three positive clones were obtained after screening IO phage. DNA sequencing of both strands of each clone was performed using a PCR procedure employing fluorescent dideoxynucleotides and a model 373A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). This analysis demonstrated that these clones corresponded to overlapping cDNAs. The sequence of the largest clone (1419 bp) includes the complete JNKl coding region. Pfaamlds The JNK7 cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pCMV5 (Andersson et al., 1999) between the Xbal and Hlndlll sites. A PCR-based procedure was employed to insert an epitope tag (Asp-Tyr-Lys-AspAsp-Asp-Asp-Lys) between codons 1 and 2 of the JNKI cDNA (Ho et al., 1999). A similar method was employed to insert an HA epitope tag. Substitution of the phosphorylation sites Thr-193 and Tyr-155 by Ala and Phe, respectively, was performed by cassette mutagenesis using a degenerate double-stranded oligonucleotide and the Pstl and Sty1 restrictton sites. The sequence of these constructs was confirmed by automated sequencing with a model 373A DNAsequencer (Applied Bitsystems).  Cell 1036  GST or GST-cJun immobilized on 10 ul of GSH-agarose at 4OC for 5 hr. The beads were washed four times with buffer A and JNKI was eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Protein Kinase Assays lmmunocomplex kinase assays using either M2 immunoprecipitates or purified JNKI , JNK-46, and ERKl or ERW were performed at 30°C for 20 min using 3 pg of substrate, 20 uM ATP, and 5 pCi of jy-PP]ATP in 30 ul of kinase buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 7.61, 20 mM MgC12, 20 mM 8glycerophosphate, 20 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM DTT). The reactions were terminated with Laemmli sample buffer and the products were resolved by SDSPAGE (12% gel). JNKl protein activity was also measured after SDSPAGE by the in-gel kinase assay with the substrate GST-cJun(l-79) as described by Hibi et al. (1993). Solid-phase protein kinase assays were performed as described by Hibi et al. (1993). Clarified cell extracts were incubated with GST-fusion proteins immobilized on GSH-agarose beads. After 3 hr at 4OC, the beads were washed extensively and bound JNK was detected by the addition of [y-92P]ATP. The reaction was terminated after 10 min at 30°C and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The incorporation of pP]phosphate was visualized by autoradiography and quantttated with a phosphorimager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Incorporated). The methods used for phosphopeptide mapping (Boyle et al., 1991) and phosphoamino acid analysis (Alvarez et al., 1991) were described previously. Acknowledgments We thank Dr. M.

														<Abstract>A protein ligand for the ECK receptor protein-tyrosine kinase has been isolated by using the extracellular domain (ECK-X) of the receptor as an affinity reagent. Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant B61 induces autophosphorylation of ECK in intact cells, consistent with B61 being an authentic ligand for ECK. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.</Abstract>

Initially, concentrated cell culture supernatants were screened for receptor binding activity using immobilized ECK-X in a surface plasmon resonance detection system. Subsequently, supernatants from selected cell lines were fractionated directly by receptor affinity chromatography, resulting in the single-step purification of B61, a protein previously identified as the product of an early response gene induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We report here that recombinant B61 induces autophosphorylation of ECK in intact cells, consistent with B61 being an authentic ligand for ECK. ECK is a member of a large orphan receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family headed by EPH, and we suggest that ligands for other members of this family will be related to B61, and can be isolated in the same way.</BodyText>

Homologous recombination was detected at a frequency of 1 in 63 drugresistant colonies. Chimeric animals were obtained by injecting targeted cells into C57BLU6 blastocysts. Male mice showing &amp;gt;50% coat color chimerism were mated to C57BUI6 females, and germline transmission was documented by the presence of the 5.7-kb Pst fragment. I. Millet and N. H. Ruddle, J. Immunol., in press. Bioactivity of TNF-a-LT was measured with the WEHI 164 fibrosarcoma cell line as described [N. H. Ruddle et a/., J. Exp. Med. 172, 1193 (1990)]. The specificity of the assay was defined with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, TN3.19.12, that recognizes both murine TNF-a and LT. Erythrocyte-depleted cells (106) were stained for 1 hour with fluoresceinated monoclonal antibodies to CD8 (Becton Dickinson), phycoerythrinlabeled monoclonal antibodies to CD4 (Becton Dickinson), fluoresceinated monoclonal antibodies to lgM (Pharmingen), phycoerythrin-labeled monoclonal antibodies to CD45R and B220 (Pharmingen), or biotinylated monoclonal antibodies to CD3e (Pharmingen). The biotinylated monoclonal antibody was detected with streptavidin-RED613 (Gibco). Flow cytometric analysis was performed with the Lysis-l program (Becton Dickinson) on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson); data are means from experiments with three animals. Cytolytic effector cells were established by primary, one-way mixed lymphocyte cultures of 1 x 107 to 2 x 107 LT+/+ or LT-/- splenocytes (H-2b) with 2 x 107 irradiated [absorbed dose of radiation (Gy) = 20 Gy] BALB/c (H-20) splenocytes. Responding cells were either unfractionated splenocytes, purified T cells (eluted from nylon wool then treated with monoclonal antibody J 11d and complement), or purified CD4+ T cells (eluted from nylon wool then treated with J 11d and the CD8 monoclonal antibody 3.155 and complement). After culture for 5 to 6 days, live effector cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. Target cells (0.5 x 106 to 1.0 x 106) were labeled in 1 ml of RPMI-1640 for 90 min with 500 lCi of Na251CrO4 or 10 lCi of 5' 1251-labeled iododeoxyuridine (1251-UdR) as indicated, washed, incubated in the absence of label for 30 to 45 min, washed again, and added to varying numbers of effector cells. At the indicated times, release of label into the medium was assessed. After 6 hours, spontaneous 51Cr release of P815 cells (H-20) was 7%, of TA3 cells (H-2d) was 21%, and of EL-4 cells (H-2b) was 5%. The nuclear lesion was assessed by termination of the incubation with 1 mM EDTA and 0.2% Triton X-100. Spontaneous release of 1251-UdR was &amp;lt;14%. J. H. Russell and C. B. Dobos, J.

Beutler at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical  The TNF ligand family encompasses a large group of secreted and cell surface proteins that may affect the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses (1). Secreted forms of TNF and lymphotoxin-a (LT-a, previously referred to as TNF-P) are homotrimers (2) that initiate similar spectra of cellular responses by binding to two specific cell surface receptors of 60 and 80 kD (TNFR60 and TNFR80) (3). Membrane TNF, a type II transmembrane protein, is the precursor of secreted TNF (4); in contrast, cell surface LT is structurally different from secreted LT-a and TNF, which suggests that it may not bind to TNFR60 or TNFR80. Cell surface LT is a heteromeric complex composed of LT-a and LT-P subunits (5). Lymphotoxin-3 is a type II transmembrane member of the TNF ligand family that provides the membrane anchor for the attachment of the heteromeric complex to the cell surface (6). To test if LT-P confers distinct receptor binding properties to the cell surface LT-ot-LT-P complex, we used soluble versions of the TNFRs [engineered as fusion proteins between the ligand binding domain of TNFR and the Fc region of immunoglobulin GI (IgGl) (TNFR:Fc)] as probes for membrane-bound cytokines (7). Cell surface LT and TNF were rapidly induced on the human CD4+ T cell hybridoma II-23 by phorbol myristate acetate P. D. Crowe, T. L. VanArsdale, B. N. Walter, C. F.

(PMA), as detected by fluorescence staining with specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Fig. 1A) (8). Membrane TNF expression peaked 3 to 4 hours after stimulation with PMA and declined rapidly. In contrast, cell surface LT expression was maximal 6 to 8 hours after stimulation and remained detectable for more than 24 hours (Fig. 1B). The TNFR60:Fc and TNFR80:Fc chimeric proteins had similar staining patterns on 11-23 cells activated for 6 hours with PMA (Fig. 1C). To determine which cell surface ligands bind TNFR60:Fc, we used LT-a mAb (9B9) or TNF mAb (104C) competitively for staining of PMAactivated II-23 cells. Both of these mAbs block binding of the soluble ligands to TNFRs and directly neutralize cytotoxic function (9). In the presence of saturating concentrations of competitor mAb, specific staining for TNFR60:Fc was partially blocked with an LT-a mAb (Fig. iD) and more efficiently with a TNF mAb (Fig. lE), which indicates that membrane TNF binds to TNFR60. The latter finding is consistent with reports that membrane TNF is cytotoxic (4); however, these results also suggest that a less abundant form of the cell surface LT-ox-LT-P complex may also be a ligand for TNFR60 (Fig. iD). In contrast, TNFR60:Fc (or TNFR80:Fc) did not bind to II-23 cells 24 hours after activation (Fig. 1F), despite the presence of substantial antigen detectable with LT-ao mAb (compare to Fig. 1B). These findings raised the possibility that a receptor other than TNFR80 and TNFR60 may recognize the major form of cell surface LT and prompted us to test other members of the TNFR family (3) for binding to cell 707  SCIENCE  *  VOL. 264  *  29 APRIL 1994  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on November 6, 2009  surface LT. We found that an Fc fusion construct of the TNF receptor-related protein (TNFRrp), a complementary DNA (cDNA) with sequence similarity to TNFR (10), bound II-23 cells when TNFR60:Fc binding was low (Fig. 1F). Antibodies to TNF or LT-a did not block binding of TNFRrp:Fc to II-23 cells activated for 4 hours with PMA, and TNFRrp:Fc did not bind or neutralize cytotoxicity mediated by secreted LT-a or TNF (1 1), which provides additional evidence that TNF and LT-a are not ligands for TNFRrp. The ligands recognized by TNFR:Fc and TNFRrp:Fc in biosynthetically labeled II-23 extracts were identified by receptor-mediated ligand precipitation (RMLP) with the use of the Fc fusion proteins in a manner analogous to that of antibodies in immunoprecipitation (8, 12). Both TNFR60:Fc and LT-a mAb, but not TNFRrp:Fc, efficiently precipitated the LT-a (25 kD) that was secreted by II-23 cells (Fig. 2A). In the cell-associated fraction, which contains both LT-x homotrimers and LT-a-LT-1 heteromeric complexes, TNFR60:Fc coprecipitated LT-a (21 to 25 kD) and a small amount of LT-P (33 kD) (Fig. 2B). The band at 21 kD has previously been shown to be a precursor of mature LT-a (5). A second round of RMLP with TNFR6,:Fc failed to bind any additional ligand from this extract (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a third round of RMLP with TNFRrp:Fc bound an abundant amount of LT-a-LT-P complexes. In the reciprocal RMLP experiment, TNFRrp:Fc precleared a major fraction of the LT-a-LT-, complexes (Fig. 2B) but did not bind the complexes recognized by TNFR60:Fc. To unambiguously determine the specificity of TNFR:Fc and TNFRrp:Fc, we used recombinant baculovirus encoding either LT-a or a soluble form of LT-P to produce secreted LT-a-LT-P complexes by co-infection of BTI-TN-5B1-4 insect cells (12, 13). Soluble LT-P was created by deletion of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions and replacement with a type I leader sequence and a c-Myc decapeptide epitope (sLTImyc) for detection with a mAb to Myc (14). RMLP analysis with either TNFR60:Fc or TNFRrp:Fc of the ligands secreted by co-infected insect cells showed coprecipitation of LT-a and sLTf3myc proteins (Fig. 2C). In contrast, TNFRrp:Fc, but not TNFR60:Fc, precipitated sLT3myc from supematants of cells infected with sLTimyc virus alone (Fig. 2D), which indicates that TNFRrp:Fc is specific for LT-P. In light of the inability of TNFRrp to bind TNF or LT-a, we propose the more descriptive term LT-PR to denote this receptor. LT-PR contains a cysteine-rich motif characteristic of the TNF-nerve growth factor family of transmembrane receptors homologous to TNFR60 and TNFR80.

In contrast, domains 3 and 4 of LT-PR resemble those of TNFR80 in the positioning of the cysteine residues and by the presence of a dramatically shortened loop 1 (5 versus 15 residues). An additional similarity between LT-PR and TNFR80 is the membrane-proximal proline-rich region in the extracellular domain, which is thought to form a stalk extending the receptor from the cell surface. The cytoplasmic region of LT-PR has little sequence similarity with other members of the receptor family, which suggests that the mechanisms used to signal cellular responses may diverge from TNFR. The LT-PR has some similarity (over a short span) to the "death domain," which is present in Fas (16) and TNFR60 (17); it is not yet known whether LT-P ligands mediate apoptosis or cytotoxicity. The gene that encodes LT-PR spans -9 kb with an exon organization similar to that of TNFR60 and is located on 12pl3 as a cluster with CD27 and TNFR60 (18). Our data indicate that LT-a and LT-P combine to form soluble or membrane-anchored ligands that differ in receptor specificity. Secreted LT-a is a compact trimer with three identical receptor binding sites located in the surface cleft between neighboring subunits primarily in the a-a" and d-e loops found on opposite sides of each subunit SCIENCE *  (15, 19). Structural similarity and molecular modeling indicate that LT- may have a molecular architecture similar to that of LT-cx, which suggests that a model for the surface LT complex should be a trimer in which subunits can assemble to form two complexes, LTaeLI2 and LTa2I3. Crosslinking studies provided evidence for a stoichiometry of LTa1132 for the major cell surface LT complex (5). However, amino acids in LT-P corresponding to TNFR60 contact residues of LT-a are not highly conserved, which predicts that a cleft formed between the LT-P and LT-a subunits in LTa1I2 may not preserve the TNFR, binding site. The data presented here indicate that TNFR60:Fc does not bind the major cell surface LT complex but rather binds a distinct complex with a predicted subunit ratio of LTa2P1. In contrast, LT1R:Fc binds to the major cell surface LT complex and to sLT3myc but not to the ligands recognized by TNFR60:Fc. The ligands that bind to LT-R:Fc, LTaIP2, and sLTimyc are predicted to have a common cleft formed by neighboring LT-j3 subunits, analogous to the TNFR60 binding site formed by adjacent LT-at subunits. The multivalent ligands TNF and LT-a probably initiate cellular responses by inducing aggregation (clustering) of TNFR60 or TNFR80 (20). The model predicts that each LT-oa-LT-, heterotrimer has a single receptor binding site composed of either an aa or PP cleft and two distinct a13 clefts. Theoretically, these heteromeric ligands would be unable to induce clustering ofeither TNFR, or LT-PR and thus may function as  VOL. 264  *  29 APRIL 1994  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on November 6, 2009  El p60:Fc  E] p60:Fc  Fig. 1.

Alternatively, low-affinity binding to the o43 clefts by either TNFR or LT-PR may be sufficient to induce receptor aggregation. Another possibility that cannot be excluded is the existence of a receptor specific for the ax clefts of LTa2I31 or LTa1IP2, enabling these ligands to induce coclustering of distinct receptors including TNFRk, TNFR80, or LT-P3R. The expression of cell surface LT-a-LT-P complexes by activated lymphocytes, such as cytotoxic T cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-stimulated natural killer cells (21), suggests the potential for these ligands to function as positive or negative regulators in inflammatory and immune responses.

David Smith*t and A. Richard Palmer Crabs grown experimentally on fully shelled prey developed larger and stronger claws than those raised on nutritionally equivalent unshelled prey. When one claw was immobilized, claws also became asymmetrical. These use-induced changes differ from skeletal remodelling in vertebrates and many invertebrates because changes in the rigid exoskeleton can occur only after molting, and claw muscle mass must be reduced substantially before the molt. Such short-term adaptive responses to environmental stimuli, if heritable, could yield long-term evolutionary changes in claw size and, if combined with behavioral biases toward one side (handedness), could also promote the evolution of claw dimorphism.  The form of biological structures can be developmentally sensitive or insensitive to environmental conditions. Plasticity, however, may be either adaptive or nonadaptive depending on whether fitness is altered in individuals whose form has changed (1, 2). In addition, plasticity may either accelerate the rate of evolution by generating phenotypic variation or retard it by reducing the concordance between genotypes and phenotypes (35). Phenotypic plasticity can thus be significant on both ecological and evolutionary time scales. Although numerous predators induce changes that make prey more resistant (6-8), relatively little is known about how sensitive predator form is to differences in prey toughness, because previous studies have had difficulty separating nutritional effects from useinduced effects in fishes (9-11) and insects (12). Adaptive plasticity in predator feeding structures may have contributed to the coevolutionary arms race between durophagous predators and shelled prey (13). We tested the effect of diet toughness on both claw form and performance of the brachyuran crab, Cancer productus. Brachyuran crabs include many ecologically important predators that use their claws to subjugate shelled prey (14). Claw size and leverage properties determine crushing force (15, 16), and induction or reversal of claw asymmetry after autotomy in certain Department of Zoology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G 2E9, and Bamfield Marine Station, Bamfield, British Columbia VOR 1 BO, Canada. *Present address: Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Post Office Box 28, Edgewater, MD 21037, USA. tTo whom correspondence should be addressed. 710  heterochelous species suggests substantial developmental lability (17-19). But because of constraints imposed on muscle volume by a rigid exoskeleton and because of extensive muscle atrophy before molting, we don't know whether differential use can affect subsequent form in crustaceans. Cancer productus is a common molluscivorous crab in estuaries and bays of the northeastem Pacific Ocean (20). Field-collected juveniles were held in running-seawater aquaria at the Bamfield Marine Station, Bamfield, British Columbia (21). Roughly equal numbers of male and female crabs were as We  examined the effects of diet toughness on relative claw size by computing the approximate volume of the manus (the portion of the claw excluding the fingers) (24) for each molt of each crab and adjusting for differences in overall crab size (25). For one analysis, we also computed a standardized claw size by adjusting for differences in relative claw size among individuals in the pretreatment molt. Differences in relative claw size among the six treatments (note that glued and free claws in the one-claw glued treatments were analyzed separately) were tested with  (24).  Table 1.

Before the first molt in captivity, all crabs had full use ofboth claws and were fed an excess of small, intact mussels (Mytilus) well below the maximum size they could crush. After the first molt, by which time crabs were nearing maturity, all crabs were placed on their respective experimental diets. Crabs on a hard diet (H) received intact, closed mussels within 20% of the maximum size they could crush (22). Those on a soft diet (S) received similarly sized, opened mussels, where the flesh was easily accessible. For half of the individuals on each diet type, either a right or left claw was glued closed at random with cyanoacrylate glue within 48 hours after the first and all subsequent molts in captivity. By using only Myrilus as food, we avoided potentially confounding nutritional differences among treatments that have complicated interpretation of diet-induced effects elsewhere (9, 11, 12). Crabs were reared through one or two entire intermolt cycles on the experimental diets, and crushing forces were measured after the second molt (23). Claw measurements were obtained from preserved exoskeletons  </BodyText></FullTextData>

															<Abstract>CD5 is a T-cell-specific antigen which binds to the B-cell antigen CD72 and acts as a coreceptor in the stimulation of T-cell growth. CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor zeta chain (TcR zeta)/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR zeta/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck and can act as a substrate for p56lck. Coexpression of CD5 with p56lck in the baculovirus expression system resulted in the phosphorylation of CD5 on tyrosine residues. Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56lck coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcR zeta/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p59fyn(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells. The binding of p56lck to CD5 induced a 10- to 15-fold increase in p56lck catalytic activity, as measured by in vitro kinase analysis. In vivo labelling with 32P(i) also showed a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 occupancy in p56lck when associated with CD5. The use of glutathione S-transferase-Lck fusion proteins in precipitation analysis showed that the SH2 domain of p56lck could recognize CD5 as expressed in the baculovirus expression system.

CD5 associates with the T-cell receptor g chain (TcR()/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcRg/CD3 ligation. However, despite this, the mechanism by which CD5 generates intracellular signals is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CD5 is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p561ck and can act as a substrate for p56Ick.

Further, anti-CD5 and anti-p56"k coprecipitated each other in a variety of detergents, including Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Anti-CD5 also precipitated the kinase from various T cells irrespective of the expression of TcRg/CD3 or CD4. No binding between p590n(T) and CD5 was detected in T cells.

The CD5-p56"ck interaction is likely to play roles in T-cell signalling and T-B collaboration.  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  The pan-T-cell marker CD5/Ly-1 antigen is a 69-kDa monomeric antigen that belongs to a family of receptors typified by the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich family of extracellular domain-like structures (19, 22, 38). This family includes the type I macrophage scavenger receptor, the human complement factor 1, the sea urchin speract receptor, and the lymphoid antigen CD6 (3, 25). Although highly conserved, members of this receptor family have been reported to bind ligands as diverse as speract peptides and the B-cell antigen CD72 (25). As in the case of CD2, CD4, CD6, and CD28, CD5 has been hypothesized to act as a second signal in the activation pathway of T cells. In this sense, CD5 can provide costimulatory signals in the proliferation of T cells (1, 10, 28, 51). Costimulation increases intracellular Ca2' and cyclic GMP levels (27), interleukin 2 (IL-2) secretion, and interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) expression (10, 23). Other monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to CD5 have been reported to stimulate T-cell growth directly or in conjunction with CD28 (10, 28, 63). CD5 has been reported to bind to the B-cell antigen CD72 (31, 59), a finding consistent with the observation that CD5 augments T-cell help for B-cell immunoglobulin production (55). CD5 can physically associate with the T-cell receptor 4 chain (TcR;)/CD3 complex on the surface of T cells, an interaction may account for the functional dependency of CD5 on TcR(/ CD3 expression (5, 9, 36). In this sense, CD5 shares a number of properties with TcR(. Both can be coprecipitated with TcR4/CD3 in gentle detergents and are rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to TcR(/CD3 ligation (9, 14, 45). Both TcR~and CD5 possess part of a potential tyrosine  Corresponding author.

The Y-XX-L submotif found in the TcR~and CD3 chains has been replaced by a Y-XX-P submotif in CD5. Intriguingly, the first tyrosine residue is surrounded by residues with homology to the autophosphorylation site of Src family members (DNEY) (22). The receptor therefore appears to be well constructed to act as a substrate for Src-related kinases. CD5 binding to the B-cell antigen CD72 may facilitate collaboration between T and B lymphocytes. Over the past few years, a variety of T-cell antigens involved in T-cell signalling have been found to be complexed to members of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases. Initially, CD4 and CD8 were found to associate with protein-tyrosine kinase p561ck (4, 44; for a review, see reference 42). Other regulatory receptors such as TcR;/CD3, IL-2R , chain, Thy-1, and Ly-6 have also been shown to associate with Src kinases (18, 52). Binding is mediated by C-X-C-P motif in the CD4/ CD8 ot-chain cytoplasmic tail and by N-region sequences of p56/ek in the case of CD4-p56 ck and CD8-p56Ick (47,48,57). By contrast, the N-terminal region of the kinase domain of p561ck mediates binding to the IL2-R c chain (18). CD4-p56lck activity is regulated by ligand-induced receptor cross-linking (30, 62). The CD4-p56 ck interaction is required for coreceptor function (17), while p56lck expression is required for T-cell stimulation and thymic differentiation (33, 53). Given our previous findings showing the CD5 associates with the TcR(/CD3 complex and is rapidly phosphorylated with receptor ligation, we were interested in whether CD5 could interface with Src-related kinases such as pS6lck. In this report, we demonstrate that CD5 has the unusual property of acting as both a substrate and a receptor for p561ck. The bindinz of pS6lck with CD5 also resulted in the stimulation of p56ic activity. CD5-p56lck is likely to account for the costimulatory function of CD5 and may play a role in the regulation of T-B collaboration in the immune response. 2862  VOL. 14, 1994  CD5 INTERACTION WITH  p561ck  2863  MATERIALS AND METHODS  infection, cell supemratants containing both wild-type and recombinant viruses were removed and plaqued on a monolayer of Sf21 cells. Recombinant virus plaques were identified visually by their occlusion-negative phenotype (54). Recombinant virus was purified from contaminating wild-type virus by two rounds of plaque purification, and high-titered lysates (107 to 108 PFU/ml) of recombinant baculovirus were obtained. Lck-baculovirus recombinants were kindly provided by Gerhard Raab. DNA sequences encoding the SH2 (residues 127 to 234), SH3 (62 to 126), and SH2/SH3 (62 to 234) domains of Lck tyrosine kinase were amplified by PCR from plasmid containing full-length murine lck cDNA, using specific 3' and 5' primers that included restriction sites for BamHI and EcoRI, and subcloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) cut with BamHI and EcoRI. Competent Eschenichia coli DH5a was used for transformation and expression of the fusion proteins (49). Protein production and Western blotting (immunoblotting). Sf21 cells (1.5 x 106) were seeded into 35-mm-diameter cell culture dishes. Plates were infected with either baculovirus encoding p56kk or coinfected with baculovirus encoding p56k/c and baculovirus encoding CD5. At different times postinfection, the confluent monolayers of Sf21 cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (8 mM K2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, 145 mM NaCl) and subsequently lysed with 200 pl lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 1% [vol/vol] Triton  synthetic peptide' corresponding to the N-terminal residues 39 to 64 (gift of P.

Rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin was obtained from Dako Corporation (Carpinteria, Calif.). AntiCD27 and anti-CD26 antibodies have been described before (34, 43). T cells (Jurkat, Peer IV) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum and 1% (wt/vol) penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. TcRICD3-negative Jurkat T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Spodoptera frugiperda cell line IPLB-Sf21 (Sf21) (60) was propagated as a monolayer culture in Sf 900 insect medium (Gibco/ BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 ,ug of gentamicin per ml as described by Brown and Faulkner (8). Viral infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for protein production and for labelling experiments or of 0.1 for virus production. cDNA cloning. Isolation of a cDNA clone encoding CD5 was performed by cDNA synthesis as described previously (21). Briefly, total cellular RNA was extracted from Jurkat cells by guanidinium-cesium chloride, and cDNA synthesis was performed with a random primer. After PCR amplification using CD5-specific oligonucleotides with restriction sites for EcoRI, the resultant PCR product was purified and cloned in the EcoRI site of pVl1393 to generate pVl1393-CD5. For cDNA encoding CD4 (kindly provided by Richard Axel, Columbia University, New York, N.Y.), recombinant transfer vectors were prepared by CD4 DNA amplification by PCR using specific oligonucleotides and cloning into the EcoRI site of the transfer vector pV11393. The S. frugiperda cell line was then transfected with a mixture of linear wild-type baculoviral DNA (Invitrogen) and pVl1393-DNA constructs. Two days after  MAbs, antisera, and cells. MAbs used included antibodies (ImmunoGen, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.) (24T6G12; immunoglobulin G2) (9) and to CD4 (19Thy5D7; immunoglobulin'G2) (39). Anti-p56/c/ MAbs were generated against a to CD5  phothreonine, and phosphotyrosine at a concentration of 1 mg/ml as reference. Separation of the amino acids was performed at 1,000 V (12). The phosphoamino acid markers were visualized by using ninhydrin spray, and the radioactivity was located by autoradiography. For two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping, proteins were eluted from gel slices and digested with 10 jig of trypsin, and  subjected to immunoprecipitations. Phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphotryptic peptide mapping. Protein phosphorylated in vivo or in vitro was purified from SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels visualized by autoradiography. The extrafted protein was subjected to acid hydrolysis for 3 h at 1 10°C with 200 RA of 6 M HCl. H20 (200 RI) was added, and the samples were lyophilized and resuspended in 10 pl of H20. Aliquots (0.5 to 2 pl) were separated on a thin-layer cellulose plate (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), using 3 ,l of a mixture containing phosphoserine, phos X-100,  1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM leupeptin). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 10 min, 4°C). The proteins were boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (26), and transferred to nitrocellulose (56). Nitrocellulose was blocked with 2% gelatin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), washed thrice in TBS, and incubated with anti-Lck (1:2,000) in TBS with Tween 20 (TBST). Samples were then washed thrice with TBST prior to incubation with mouse anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase. Bands were visualized by alkaline phosphatase reaction (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Immunoprecipitation and kinase assay. Cells (1 x 106 to 2 x 106) were lysed in 200 RI of lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. To remove the cellular debris, lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was precleared with 100 ,u of SAC (10% suspension in lysis buffer). Immunoprecipitation was then carried out by incubation of the lysate with the antibody for 1 h at 4°C. The mixture was further incubated with 50 RI of protein A-Sepharose beads (10% [wt/vol]) for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer and suspended in 30 RI of kinase buffer (10 mM N2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [HEPES; pH 7.2], 3.5 mM MgCl2, 3.5 mM MnCJ2) containing 10 to 20 ,uCi of [y-32P]ATP and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The sample were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, and the phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For reprecipitations, SDS (1% [wt/vol]) and ethanol (0.1% [vol/vol]) were added to the samples, which were then denatured by boiling for 5 min, diluted to 0.1% SDS with lysis buffer, and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (44). For the reprecipitation analysis of Jurkat cells, cells were solubilized in 1% Brij 96 lysis buffer with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and subjected to the first immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assay. The precipitated and 32P-labelled proteins were solubilized again radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer, subjected to immunoprecipitation with the second antibody, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Two-dimensional nonequilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis was conducted with ampholines of a pH range between 3 and 11 as described previously (35, 41). In vivo labelling studies. Sf21 cells were infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5. At 48 h postinfection, cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-free medium. Labelling of 1 x 106 to 2 x 106 cells was performed with 1 mCi of 32p; (NEN) for 3 h in phosphate-free medium.

The first dimension was conducted on 0.1-mm-thick cellulose plates (E. Merck) by electrophoresis in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.9; 1,000 V for 30 min) followed by ascending chromatography in the second dimension [butanol-pyridineacetic acid-water [75:50:15:60) (20, 37). RESULTS effort to establish whether CD5 was capable of direct binding to Src family members, the receptor was analyzed from various T cells and as expressed in the baculovirus expression system. With use of nondisruptive detergents, anti-CD5 has In an  been found to coprecipitate pS6lck, p59&amp;f, and the TcR4/CD3 complex (5, 9). However, these studies did not distinguish between the direct binding of p56Ick to CD5 and the coprecipitation of other receptor complexes such as CD4-p56Ick or TcRC-p59'5". To circumvent the possible coprecipitation of TcR4/CD3 or CD4-p56Ik complexes, CD5 was precipitated from different TcRC/CD3 and CD4-negative T-cell lines and assayed for coprecipitated kinase activity. [32P]ATP-labelled immune complexes were then denatured by boiling in SDS and subjected to reprecipitation with anti-Lck and anti-Fyn antisera. As seen in Fig. IA, p56lck, but not p59fyf, was readily coprecipitated with CD5 from lysates from Jurkat cells lacking  VOL. 14, 1994  CD5 INTERACTION WITH  p56"1k  2865  resulted in the synthesis of CD5 as a 55-kDa polypeptide. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing of the labelled CD5p561Ck complex showed two sets of spots at opposite ends of the pH gradient (Fig. 2A). A doublet corresponding to p561ck was noted at the acidic end of the gradient at pH of 4.9 to 5.2, as previously described (4, 44). This corresponded to p561ck, as shown in the pattern of anti-p56Ick precipitates from cells expressing Ick alone (Fig. 2C). Coprecipitation of CD5-p56/ck was reciprocal, as shown by the ability of anti-p56 ck to coprecipitate CD5 (Fig. 2B) and vice versa (Fig. 2A). Peptide map analysis further showed the basic 55-kDa spot to have a pattern distinct from the upper and lower molecular mass p56/ck bands (Fig. 2D, lane 1 versus lanes 2 and 3). Reprecipitation analysis further showed that labelled CD5 could be  TcRC/CD3 expression and from the same lysates that had been subjected to depletion with anti-CD4 antibody (Fig. IA, lanes 3 and 4). Similarly, CD5 precipitations from CD4-negative Peer IV T cells were found to coprecipitate p56/1k (Fig. 1A, lower panel, lane 3). Control antibodies such as rabbit antimouse (lane 2) failed to reprecipitate material. These data showed that CD5 and p56/ek can interact in a cellular environment where CD4, CD8, and TcR4/CD3 are not present. To directly assess this possibility, CD5 and p561ck were coexpressed in Sf21 insect cells and assayed for complex formation. Cell lysates from Sf21 cells that had been infected with various proteins (CD5, Lck, Ras, and CD4) were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. IB). As expected, expression of p56"lk resulted in the detection of a band at 55 to 60 kDa corresponding to the kinase (lane 2), while expression of CD5 alone (lane 1), CD5 and p2lras (lane 4), and CD4 (lane 5) failed to be detected with the antiphosphotyrosine antibody. By contrast, the coexpression of CD5 with p56/ck showed a greatly enhanced in vivo labelling of material in the molecular mass range of p56lck (i.e., 55 to 60 kDa) (lane 3). A similar effect was observed in Sf21 cells which coexpressed CD4 and p56/ck (lane 6). This change in phosphotyrosine labelling upon coexpression of CD5 and p56Ick suggested a possible interaction. In an effort to directly establish whether CD5 and p56 1k could physically interact, anti-CD5 was used to immunoprecipitate antigen from a Triton X-100-based detergent cell lysates, followed by labelling in an in vitro kinase assay with [32P]ATP. Significantly, under these conditions, anti-CD5 precipitated high levels of p56/ck activity, resulting in the labelling of bands at 62 kDa and an intermediate band at 59 kDa (Fig. 1C, lane 4). By contrast, CD5 alone failed to show coprecipitated in vitro kinase activity, indicating that CD5 did not bind to detectable levels of an endogenous kinase in the Sf21 cells and that CD5 is itself not a kinase (Fig. IC, lane 2). The level of activity in anti-CD5 from CD5/p56ICk-coinfected cells was similar to that precipitated by anti-p56lLk from cells infected with 561ck alone (lane 1) or from cells infected with CD5 and p56Ic (lane 3). The major difference in the patterns was that anti-p56 Ck coprecipitated bands primarily at 56 and 62 kDa, while anti-CD5 precipitated bands at 62 and 59 kDa (lanes 1 and 3 versus lane 4). As a positive control, anti-CD4 precipitates from cells coexpressing CD4 and p56lck showed a band at 62 kDa (lane 6), while no material was detected from cells expressing CD4 alone (lane 7). As a negative control for the specificity of precipitation, rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (Fig. ID, lane 3) and antibodies to CD26 (Fig. ID, lane 4), CD27 (Fig. ID, lane 5), or CD4 (Fig. ID, lane 6) failed to precipitated kinase activity. Glycosylated CD5 has a molecular mass of 69 kDa; however, incomplete processing of the protein expressed in Sf21 cells  precipitated from labelled immune complexes (Fig. 2E, lane 6). The CD5-pS6I"k complex could also be extracted in various detergents, as detected by immunoblotting with an anti-Lck antibody (Fig. 3). Anti-CD5 precipitates from Brij 96 (lane 4)-, Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) (lane 5)-, and Triton X-100 (lane 6)-based lysates coprecipitated kinase activity (upper panel) as well as p561k, as detected by immunoblotting (lower panel). The activity and amount of precipitable p56I'k did not vary significantly with different detergents. For the purpose of comparison, anti-CD4 also precipitated high levels of kinase activity from Brij 96-, NP-40-, and Triton X-100-based detergents (upper panel; lanes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The amount of p56"/c protein precipitated by CD4 was significantly higher than that detected in association with CD5. Excluding the possibility that an additional component from insect cells might facilitate an interaction between receptor and kinase, these data strongly suggest that p561ck associates with CD5 and that the interaction is stable in variety of detergents. Given that CD5 and p56Ick associate in a complex, an important issue concerned whether CD5 binding could regulate p56l1k activity. Previous studies have shown that the interaction of middle T antigen of polyomavirus activates pp6Q rc activity (6, 13). In vitro kinase analysis demonstrated that coexpression of CDS and p561ck resulted in a marked increase in the autophosphorylation of p56I'k (Fig. 2A and B versus C). This was particularly the case when anti-CD5 was used to precipitate the kinase (Fig. 2A versus C). Further, under these conditions, the amount of p561ck coprecipitated by CD5 (Fig. 3, lanes 4 to 6) was considerably less than that precipitated by the anti-p56l(k sera (data not shown). Importantly, similar observations were obtained from cells labelled in vivo with 32p;. As seen in Fig. 4, anti-p56Ick precipitated a well-labelled doublet at 56 and 62 kDa from cells infected with the kinase alone (lane 1). No material was detected from noninfected cells (data not shown). Anti-CD5 precipitated labelled material in the 59- to 62-kDa range from cells coinfected with CD5 and p56/ck (lane 3). The bands comigrated with bands precipitated by anti-p56 ck (lane 4). As a negative control, rabbit anti-mouse antibodies failed to precipitate material (lane 2). Similarly, anti-CDS failed to precipitated material from cells infected with CD5 alone (lane 5). As a positive control, coinfection of CD4 and kinase allowed the detection of the same doublet by anti-Lck (lane 8) or anti-CD4 antibodies (lane 7). Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping of p56Ick labelled with 32p; showed two peptides, one possessing Y-394 and another corresponding to a peptide carrying Y-505 (Fig. 5A to C). The expression of p56lck alone showed the labelling of both peptides, with more heavily labelling of Y-505 carrying peptide than Y-394 peptide (Fig. 5A). However, in contrast, the coexpression of p56I'k with CD5 caused a marked shift in the level of labelling of Y-394 relative to Y-505 (Fig. SB and C). The labelling of Y-394 was further enriched when anti-CD5 was used to copurify p56Ick, indicating that altered phosphorylation pattern occurred on p56Ick associated with CDS (Fig. SB). However, a significant increase in Y-394 phosphorylation was also observed in anti-Lck precipitates, which should precipitate both CD5-bound and unbound enzyme (Fig. SC). Quantitation of eluted peptides further demonstrated that p56lck binding to CDS induced a four- to fivefold increase in Y-394 phosphorylation (Fig. SD). The increase in Y-394 phosphorylation was usually ac2ompanied by a coordinate decrease in Y-5O5 phosphorylation (Fig. SD). Taken together, in vitro and in vivo analyses indicate that kinase binding to CDS was sufficient to stimulate p56/ck catalytic activity.

It was next of interest to assess whether CD5 was itself phosphorylated in vivo by p56 ck. Previous work by ourselves (9) and others (14) has shown that CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues as a result of TcR;/CD3 ligation. Furthermore, CD5 was readily labelled by pS6lck in vitro (Fig. 2). Two-dimensional gel analysis of anti-CD5 precipitates from Sf21 cells coinfected with CD5 and pS6lck and labelled in vivo with 32Pi clearly showed the labelling of CD5 (Fig. 6A). Reprecipitation with anti-CD5 also precipitated CD5 (Fig. 6B, lane 4). Two bands were precipitated by anti-Lck (Fig. 6B, lane 3). Specificity was demonstrated by the inability of an irrelevant antibody against CD27 to precipitate antigen (Fig. 6B,  lane 2). Phosphoamino acid analysis of in vivo-labelled CD5 revealed phosphorylation on tyrosine (Fig. 6A, right panel; Fig. 6B, right panel). As a positive control, p56 ck was also found labelled on tyrosine (Fig. 6A, right panel). CD5 was not labelled in the absence of coexpressed p561k (Fig. 4, lane 5). These data indicate that in addition to associating with the kinase, CD5 serves as a substrate for p56Ick. Two approaches were used to begin to map the region within p56 ck responsible for binding to CD5. Initially, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins consisting of the Lck SH2, Lck SH3, or Lck SH2/SH3 domains were used to precipitate CD5 from Sf21 cell lysates infected with CD5.

Under these conditions, the GST-Lck SH2 domain precipitated significant amounts of CD5 (lane 1), while no material was precipitated with use of the Lck SH3 domain or the GST control (lanes 2 and 4). In another approach, the GST-SH2 protein was also found to precipitate a band corresponding to CD5 from insect cells that were infected with CD5 and labelled with [35S]methionine (Fig. 7B). The GST-SH2 protein precipitated a heavily labelled band at 55 to 60 kDa (lane 3) that comigrated with a band precipitated by anti-CD5 (lane 1). The relatively faint amount of CD5 precipitated by the anti-CD5 antibody is reflected by the inability of antibody to function efficiently in immunoprecipitation (data not shown). The GST fusion protein failed to precipitate material (lane 2). Coexpression of Lck and CD5 followed by in vitro labelling showed an apparent increase in the level of material in the 55- to 60-kDa range precipitated by  ., FIG. 5.

This observation indicates that the p56lck SH2 domain is capable of recognizing CD5 as expressed in insect cells.  DISCUSSION Stimulation of T cells via the TcR;/CD3 complex involves the combined action of coreceptors, protein-tyrosine kinases, and phosphatases. CD4 and CD8 binding to p56/ck is likely to contribute the kinase to a multimeric complex composed of the CD3 -y, 8, and £ chains and the TcR 4 and -q chains. CD3 subunits and TcR; in turn bind to other protein-tyrosine kinases, p59fyn(T) and ZAP-70 (11, 46). In this study, we have described another type of receptor-kinase interaction in which antigen can serve as both receptor and substrate for p56lck. CD5-associated p561ck was detected in T cells, either in the absence or in the presence of the TcR;/CD3 or CD4-p56lck complex (Fig. 1), and was expressed in the baculovirus expression system (Fig. 2 to 6). Coprecipitation of CD5 and p56lck was reciprocal, being detected with either anti-CD5 or anti-Lck antibodies (Fig. 2). Complexes were detected at various stages (24 to 70 h) of the infection cycle and were not dependent on levels of protein expression (data not shown). The CD5-p56Ick complex is relatively stable, since it was also readily detected in different detergents (including Triton X-100 and NP-40), as detected by in vitro kinase labelling and immunoblotting (Fig. 3). The CD5-p56Ick interaction exhibits several novel characteristics. First, coexpression of CD5 with pS6lck induced an increase in kinase activity, as measured by increased in vitro activity (Fig. 2). Increased in vitro phosphorylation of enolase was also detected (data not shown).

Phosphoamino acid analysis of the phospholabelled CD5 antigen (lane 4) was conducted as described in Materials and Methods. to 15-fold increase in kinase activity relative to free kinase.  Importantly, in vivo phosphorylation studies also showed a four- to fivefold increase in phosphorylation at Y-394 (Fig. 5). Different antibodies to the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of Lck precipitated the same levels of activity, arguing that antibody recognition did not itself alter the activity of the kinase (data not shown). Whether the activation of p561ck is induced by intermolecular binding to cytoplasmic sequences or by the formation of CD5 dimers remains to be established. Positively charged peptides have been reported to activate p561ck (7). Consistent with this, the CD5 cytoplasmic sequence possesses a region enriched in positively charged residues (KKLVKKFRQKK) that is conserved in humans and mice (19). CD5-p56 ck therefore appears to differ from other receptor systems in that some activation occurs in the absence of an extracellular ligand. The functional rationale for this mode of regulation is unknown but may involve the need for primed receptor-kinase complexes in the case of low-affinity cell-tocell interactions. CD5 on T cells has been reported to bind to CD72 on B cells and as such to play a role in T-B collaboration  (31, 59). Interchain regulation of Src kinase has previously been noted for middle T antigen of polyomavirus or p47gag-crk binding to pp6okrc (13, 32). Whether other Src-related kinases can interact with CD5 is unclear. While we have previously shown that p59fyn(T) can be coprecipitated with CD5 from peripheral T cells that had been solubilized in the detergent Brij 96 (9), the association was generally not seen in anti-CD5 precipitates from Jurkat cells (Fig. 1A). Unlike CD5 and p561c, the coexpression of CD5 with p59)5n(T) yielded inconsistent results (data not shown). Unlike CD4 and CD8-p56Ick (44), CD5 serves as a substrate for the kinase to which it binds. Coexpression of CD5 and p561ck resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of CD5, as detected by in vivo labelling (Fig. 6). This observation is consistent with the previous finding that CD5 is rapidly phosphorylated in response to TcRC/CD3 ligation (9, 14). p561ck in proximity to the TcR(/CD3 complex as a receptor-free kinase or CD4/CD8- or CD5-associated kinase could induce the phosphorylation of CD5. CD5 possesses a Y-Xl 1-Y-XXL motif that is similar to that found in other receptors (40), as well as a motif (DNEY) that is homologous to the autophosphorylation site for Src kinases (22). Hence, the antigen appears to be well designed to act as a substrate for p561ck. CD5 represents one of the few substrates that have been identified for p56Ick. The fact that CD5 and another substrate, TcRt, are surface receptors suggests the possibility that Src kinases have an affinity for surface receptors as substrates (42). In the case of CD5, it remains to be established whether CD5 becomes phosphorylated before or after its association with p56lck. p561 could function in a kind of autoregulatory loop, phosphorylating the site to which it eventually binds by means of its SH2 domain. Binding and phosphorylation of CD5 by p561ck is likely to contribute to the functional properties of this antigen. Not surprisingly, anti-CD5 antibody can provide costimulatory signals in the proliferation of T cells, similar to CD4 and CD8 (1, 2, 16, 51). Similarly, certain MAbs to CD5 have been  VOL. 14, 1994  CD5 INTERACTION WITH p561Ck  2869  reported to directly stimulate T-cell growth or to stimulate in conjunction with CD28 (10, 28, 63). Anti-CD5 cross-linking can also induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous substrates (1, 9). Therefore, CD5-p56 ck may provide signals analogous to those of the CD4- and CD8-p56kck complexes. CD5 association with the TcRt/CD3 complex would facilitate this coreceptor function (5, 9). The ability of CD5 to act as a substrate for pS6kk is also reminiscent of the TcRICD3associated t chain. Both can be coprecipitated with the TcRI CD3 complex in mild detergents and are rapidly phosphorylated upon TcR/CD3 ligation. TcRt phosphorylation allows for the recruitment of ZAP-70 by means of SH2 binding (11). binding and activity. Phosphorylation of CD5 may in turn allow for the subsequent association of intracellular proteins. The use of GST fusion proteins provided evidence in support of the notion that the SH2 domain of p561ck may bind to CD5. GST-p56Ick SH2 fusion proteins precipitated CD5 from insect cell lysates, while GST alone failed to bind to the antigen (Fig. 7). SH2 domains are composed of a 13-pleated sheet surrounded by two a helices that bind to phosphotyrosine and adjacent hydrophobic residues (15, 64). Src kinase SH2 domains bind a certain defined motifs, with optimal binding to pYEEI (50). CD5 carries several potential binding sites that include Y-407 (YKKL), Y-458 (YSQP), Y-470 (YPAL), and Y-492 (YDLH) (19, 22). Although none are optimal, the Y-407 (YKKL) and Y-470 (YPAL) motifs share residues at the first and third positions with the alternate Src SH2 domain binding motif pYXXL (50). GST-SH2 recognition of CD5 was made against lysates from insect cells expressing CD5. Insect cells carry endogenous tyrosine kinases that may have provided sufficient phosphorylation to allow for SH2 domain recognition of CD5. The phosphorylation may have been too low to be detected by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 1B, lane 1) or by in vivo labelling (Fig. 4, lane 5). Further work is required to determine whether Lck SH2 domain recognition of CD5 occurs in T cells and whether other Src-related kinases are capable of associating with CD5.

We have therefore investigated whether the octamer binding proteins might physically interact with TBP, the TATA box binding protein component of the TFIID factor.

The interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of DNA or additional proteins. N- and Cterminal deletions of the different proteins were used to localize the domains involved in the interaction. We show that the POU homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are both required and sufficient for the interaction. The Octl POU domain, which is highly homologous to the Oct2 POU domain, likewise mediates interaction with TBP. The interaction can also be observed in vivo, as TBP can be co-precipitated with Oct2 from cotransfected Cosl cells and TBP co-immunoprecipitates with the endogenous Octl from HeLa cells. Cotransfection of human TBP and Oct2 expression vectors into B cells resulted in a synergistic activation of an octamer motif containing promoter.  INTRODUCTION A typical eucaryotic gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II contains complex regulatory elements composed of at least a basal promoter as well as upstream promoter and enhancer elements (1). Several general transcription factors have been identified that build up a pre-initiation complex over the basal promoter (2, 3). The upstream promoter and enhancer elements contain binding sites for transcriptional activators whose function is to help the basal promoter factors to establish this complex and in addition to increase the re-initiation rate of RNA polymerase 1 (4). Several mechanisms by which these upstream binding transcription factors could contribute to basal promoter factor binding can be envisaged. One possibility would be that upstream activators *To whom correspondence should be addressed  remove nucleosomes bound to transcriptionally inactive DNA and allow access of the general factors to the basal promoter (5-7). A second, not mutually exclusive mechanism, would be that upstream factors facilitate basal factor/promoter recognition by direct physical interaction with components of the basal transcriptional machinery. It had been shown that interaction of some upstream factors with their cognate DNA motifs increases binding of TFIID to the TATA box (8, 9). In addition, recent experiments have revealed that at least some upstream binding factors can directly interact with either TFIID (10-15) or with TFIIB (16). Although the importance of these interactions for activated transcription has not been vigorously tested, it is tempting to speculate that they contribute to the transactivation capacity of these factors. The direct physical interaction between upstream activating factors and members of the basal transcriptional machinery appears most obvious for those factors that bind to nearby promoter elements, because they would most likely be in the correct position, i.e. to allow pre-initiation complex formation. The octamer motif is found in virtually all immunoglobulin promoters within 20-40 bp upstream of the TATA element and also in a TATA proximal position in the promoters of several other genes (17, 18). Experiments in which the distance between the octamer motif and the TATA element was increased demonstrated that this motif has to be in the proximity of the TATA motif in order to function as a minimal promoter (19). However, the octamer motif is also found in some enhancer elements where it is several kb away from the TATA box (17). Several proteins have been identified that recognize the octamer motif and show distinct tissue specificities (20-22). All cloned octamer binding proteins are members of a family of transcription factors characterized by the presence of a bipartite DNA binding domain, the POU domain (23). The POU domain consists of two conserved regions, a 75 -80 amino acid POUspecific domain separated from a 60 amino acid POU-homeo domain by a less well conserved short linker region (23). The two conserved subdomains of the POU domain have been shown to be able to bind DNA individually with low affmnity, the presence of both subdomains is required for high affinity recognition of target sequences, however (24, 25). The best characterized family members are the Octl and the Oct2  +Present address: Preclinical Research, Sandoz Pharma Ltd, 4002 Basel, Switzerland  1656 Nucleic Acids Research, 1994, Vol. 22, No. 9 transcription factors. OctI is ubiquitously expressed and contributes to the activity of several ubiquitously active octamercontaining promoters (26-28). Oct2 expression is predominantly limited to lymphoid cells and this factor was believed to be responsible for the lymphoid-specific activity of the immunoglobulin promoters (21, 29, 30). However, recent analyses of the OctI and Oct2 transactivation potential in B cells and non-B cells showed that, due to the presence of additional B cell-specific activities, Octl is also able to stimulate octamerdependent promoters in B cells (31). OctI and Oct2 differ in their ability to stimulate octamer-dependent enhancer elements and this can be attributed to differences in the C-terminal transactivation domains (28, 31, 32). Recent in vitro transcription experiments demonstrated that both Octi and Oct2 can efficiently stimulate octamer-containing promoter elements by supporting an early step in initiation complex assembly (33, 34). This suggested that the Oct-proteins might directly interact with a component of the basal transcription machinery. Therefore, we have tested whether the TATA box binding protein (TBP) might interact directly with these octamer binding proteins. Here we show that Octl and Oct2 interact specifically with TBP both in vitro as well as in vivo. We show that the POU-homeodomain of Oct2 and the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal core domain of TBP are responsible for this interaction. Finally, co-transfection experiments demonstrate that Oct2 and TBP functionally cooperate in stimulating an octamer-containing promoter element in vivo. purified as described (34). 3 ,ug of the purified proteins were coupled to glutathione beads equilibrated in Dignam buffer D containing 2 mg/mi BSA. 5 ,tg of purified His-tagged Oct2 POU domain were phosphorylated with 50 units heart muscle kinase (Sigma) in 60 yl kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 12 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT) with 50 /Ci 'y-ATP to a specific activity of 5-8xl06cpm/4g. 7x 104 cpm of labeled protein were incubated with glutathione beads coupled to the indicated GST proteins in 500 Al Dignam buffer D containing 0.5% NP40 and 0.5 mg/ml BSA for 90 min at 4°C. Beads were spun down for 30 s washed extensively with Dignam buffer D/0.5 % NP40 and precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. For 'in vivo' interaction after co-transfection 3 106 Cos I cells were transfected in by electroporation with 5 jg of Oct2 and/or TBP expression vectors at a setting of 250 AF and 450 mV with a BioRad gene pulser. All transfections were adjusted to 10 Ag of DNA by addition of the respective empty expression vectors and three transfections with identical expression vector combinations were pooled. 3 days after transfection, whole cell extracts were prepared by three freeze/thaw cycles (liquid nitrogen/wet ice) in lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1mM DTT and 1 mM PMSF) as described (37). Buffer conditions were then adjusted to interaction buffer B (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5% NP40, 1mM DTT and 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol). For co-precipitation 500 jig of extract were used, pre-cleared and precipitated as above. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western immunoblotting with a 1:2000 dilution of the 3G3 monoclonal anti-TBP antibody (38) and an alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) secondary antibody (Dianova). Detection was performed using the CSPD system according to manufacturers' descriptions (Tropix -Western light system). In control experiments the anti-TBP antibody was blocked by pre-incubation with 20 yg of purified GST-TBP. For co-precipitation of endogenous proteins from HeLa nuclear extract, 3 mg of nuclear extract in interaction buffer C (same as buffer B, except that it contains 100 mM KCI instead of 100 mM NaCl) were pre-cleared and precipitated with an affinitypurified antibody raised against the N-terminal domain of the human Octl protein. Analysis of the precipitated proteins was performed as described above. For removal of chromosomal DNA from HeLa nuclear or Cosl whole cell extracts, the extracts were adjusted to 400 mM KCl (for HeLa) or 400 mM NaCl (for Cos 1), passed over a DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman DE 52) and then diluted to the respective interaction buffer conditions were x  NTA-agarose (DIAGEN) in 500 tl Dignam buffer D without EDTA (36). Ethidium bromide (EtBr) was included at the indicated concentrations in the interaction reaction where indicated. Beads were washed extensively with bufer D (-EDTA) and then incubated for 3 h with 25 ,tl of in vitro translated TBP. Beads were then washed 4 times with 1 ml of buffer D containing 7.5 mM imidazole (-EDTA) and precipitated proteins were analyzed by denaturing SDS -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. For co-precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and GST-TBP fusion proteins  MATERIAL AND METHODS Co-precipitation assays In vitro transcription and translation of Oct2 and TBP proteins was performed as described (35). 25 Ad of labeled TBP was mixed with either the equivalent amount of in vitro translated Oct2 proteins or 100 ,ug of nuclear extract and incubated on ice for 30 min. 450 d1 of interaction buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaC!, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF) was added and the reaction was pre-cleared for 2 h with 10 mg protein A-Sepharose CL4B followed by a 2 min centrifugation. 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose CL4B coupled to 2 itg of affinity purified rabbit anti-Oct2 antibodies were added to the supernatant and incubated for 4 h at 40C. The precipitate was harvested by a 1 min centrifugation and washed 4 times for 15 min each with 1 ml of interaction buffer. Finally the precipitated proteins were boiled in 50 Al of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. For precipitation reactions under RIPA conditions, the interaction buffer contained 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (DOC) and 0.1% SDS. For co-precipitation with procaryotic His-tagged proteins, 5 ytg of purified proteins were attached to 50 jtl of Ni again.  In  vitro translation reactions All plasmids for in vitro transcription reactions with Oct2 and TBP cDNAs were derivatives of the pBAT vector described previously (35). The templates for in vitro transcription reactions of the Octl/Oct2 were generated by PCR as described (39). Translation reactions in reticulocyte lysates were performed following manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Purification of proteins from bacteria An overnight culture of BL21 lysS bacteria containing the respective expression plasmid was diluted 1:50 in fresh SOC medium containing 0.02% glucose and grown at 37°C to an OD6w of 0. 8 before expression was induced by addition of  IPTG (0.25 mg/ml). After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in 0.3 volume cold PBS and then suspended in 1/20 starting volume of Dignam buffer C (-EDTA). The suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed on ice. Lysozyme was added to 0.2 mg/ml and lysis was completed for 30 min on ice. The lysate was sonified for 2 min and cleared by centrifugation at 20,000xg for 30 min. DNA was removed by chromatography over a DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman DE52) and the flowthrough and wash was loaded onto a Ni-NTA-agarose affinity column. After washing with 10 column volumes of buffer C-EDTA containing 10 mM imidazole, the column was developed with a 10-250 mM imidazole gradient. Peak fractions were diluted to 100 mM NaCl and loaded onto a heparin column (Pharmacia HiTrap). After exchanging the buffer to 100 mM KCI the column was developed with a 100 mM to 1 M KCl gradient and peak fractions (eluting at 0.5 -0.6 M KCI) were dialyzed against buffer D (-EDTA) and used for the interaction experiments.  Plasmid construction For generation of the N-terminal deletion of Oct2 the SalI site (artificially introduced over codons 2 and 3 of the Oct2 cDNA) was fused to the Sacd site at amino acid position 174 using an appropriate oligonucleotide linker. All TBP N-terminal deletions were constructed by fusion to the SalI site of the pBAT Oct2 vector, thus in all cases the AUG codon was derived from this cDNA. For deletion 100-339 the full length TBP cDNA was first recloned as a PstI -XhoI fragment in pBluescript SK. This plasmid was then linearized with XbaI, the ends were filled in with Klenow and after recutting with DraH the fragment was inserted into the SailI-EcoRI cut and Klenow filled in pBATOct2 vector. Deletion 168-339 was generated by transferring the StuI-XbaI fragment of pBAT-TBP into the Sail cut, Klenow filled in, XbaI recut pBAT-Oct2 vector. For deletion construct 272-339 the SalI site of the pBAT-Oct2 vector was first filled in with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of dCTP and dTTP, thus removing two nucleotides from the end. After recutting with XbaI the SspI-XbaI fragment from pBAT-TBP was inserted. Deletion 148-339 and the yeast TBP clone have been described previously (40). Transfection experiments S194 cells were grown and transfected by a DEAE-Dextran protocol as described (32). Typical transfection reactions contained 2 ,tg of the luciferase reporter under control of a promoter with 4 copies of the octamer motif, 1.5 Ag of each of the expression vectors (TBP expression vectors were in the pSG5 vector, Oct2 expression vectors contain the RSV enhancer/ promoter) or the empty expression plasmids. In addition, 0.5 jig of the RSV-lacZ reporter plasmid were included in each transfection reaction. All luciferase expression values were normalized for transfection efficiency using the 3-galactosidase enzyme levels.  Figure 1. TBP can be specifically co-precipitated with Oct2. In vitro translated labeled TBP protein was mixed with buffer (lane 1) or 100 ,ug of the indicated nuclear extracts (lane 2-5), incubated on ice for 30 min and then nimunoprecipitated with an Oct2-specific antiserum. The precipitate was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The position of the coprecipitated TBP is indicated at the left side. The BJA-B nuclear extracts in lanes 3 and 4 were depleted for either Oct2 (lane 3) or Octi (lane 4), respectively.

As a source of Oct2 proteins we initially used a B cell nuclear  Figure 2. Mapping of the Oct2 domain that interacts with TBP. (A) Scheme of Oct2 and the deletion mutants analyzed. The Oct2 used represents the Oct2.2 isoform (62), the relative position of the POU domain is indicated. Carboxy terminal deletions were generated by linearizing the in vitro transcription vector (35) at aa positions 99, 161, 228 and 392 with NheI, SmaI, NcoI and HindI, respectively. Generation of the N-terminal truncation is described in the Material and Methods section and the deletion 174-392 was generated by linearizing the N-terminal deletion construct with HindImI. +/- at the right side of the Figure indicates whether or not the respective deletion construct interacts with TBP. (B) Co-precipitation experiment with the unlabeled in vitro translated Oct2 deletions and labeled TBP using the Oct2-specific antibody. Precipitates were again analyzed on polyacrylamide gels and the position of TBP is indicated. Lanes 1 and 9 contain unprimed reticulocyte lysates, the other lanes contain the in vitro translated Oct2 deletions indicated on top of each lane.  1658 Nucleic Acids Research, 1994, Vol. 22, No. 9 extract prepared from the BJA-B cell line which contains large amounts of Oct2 proteins (41). Whereas no TBP was precipitated in the absence of B cell extract, roughly 10% of the input TBP was recovered when the BJA-B extract was added (Figure 1, lanes 1 and 2). When identical amounts of a HeLa nuclear extract, which does not contain Oct2 proteins, were added no TBP was brought down by the Oct2-specific antibody (Figure 1, lane 5). Depletion of the BJA-B nuclear extract for about 95 % of its Oct2 proteins by passage over an immunoaffinity column (34) resulted in a strong decrease of the amount of co-precipitated TBP (Figure 1, lane 3). In contrast, removal of Octl from the same starting extract had no significant effect on the amount of co-precipitated TBP (Figure 1, lane 4). These experiments confirmed that the TBP co-precipitation was critically dependent on the presence of Oct2 proteins in the reactions. It should be noted though that these results do not exclude an interaction between OctI and TBP, because the antibodies used were specific for Oct2 and did not cross-react with Oct 1 (see below). Oct2 outlined in Figure 2A were assayed for their ability to coprecipitate labeled TBP. The full length Oct2 protein, as well as a deletion construct removing the C-terminal transactivation domain, both interacted with TBP (Figure 2B, lanes 2 and 3). Deletions affecting or removing the POU domain abolished the interaction (Figure 2B, lanes 4-6), suggesting that the N-terminal  The Oct2 POU domain and the core domain of TBP mediate specific interaction We wanted to identify the protein domains of Oct2 and TBP required for the interaction. For these experiments the Oct2 protein was produced by in vitro translation as unlabeled protein. The full length protein or the N- and C-terminal deletions of  A  transactivation domain was not sufficient to interact with TBP. However, interaction was still seen when both the N- and Cterminal transactivation domains were deleted (Figure 2B, lane 8). Thus, the Oct2 transactivation domains are dispensable for interaction with TBP. All truncated proteins were expressed and immunoprecipitated at comparable levels (data not shown). The above Oct2 deletion analysis suggested that the POU domain mediates interaction with TBP. However, even the shortest fragment used still contained some additional sequences N- and C-terminal of the POU domain. Furthermore, the POU domain consists of two conserved subdomains, the POU-specific and the POU-homeo domain that are both important for efficient DNA binding. We therefore determined whether the TBP interaction surface localizes exclusively to the POU domain and, if yes, to which of the two subdomains. The intact POU domain, the POU-specific and the POU-homeo subdomains were expressed as bacterial fusion proteins containing six histidines at the amino terminus. Purified proteins were coupled to NiNTA - agarose beads and incubated with labeled TBP. In the presence of the intact POU domain or the POU-homeo domain, but not the POU-specific domain, TBP could be efficiently coprecipitated (Figure 3A). This result shows that the POU-homeo  ,, j  . .U iw  2M;  4;  K  gtigiEmI 11(I t :.  _   -moo_._  B  Figure  3. The POU-homeo domain mediates interaction with TBP.

Labeled TBP was incubated with buffer (lane 1), the purified Oct2 POU domain (lane 2) or the Octl POU domain (lane 3) and precipitated with Ni-NTA-agarose.  Figure 4. The interaction between Oct2 and TBP is independent of DNA and additional proteins. (A) Co-precipitation experiment using Ni-NTA-agarose, the Oct2 POU domain and labeled in vitro translated TBP. Increasing amounts of EtBr up to a final concentration of 400 itg/ml were included where indicated. (B) Co-precipitation experiment using glutathione -Sepharose. GST and GST-TBP fusion protein were purified from bacteria and coupled to the glutathione beads. No protein was coupled to the beads in the left lane.

The significant homology between OctI and Oct2 in the POU domain region as well as the fact that OctI, like Oct2, stimulated 339 transcription in vitro at the level of pre-initiation complex formation prompted us to test whether the Octl POU domain + would also interact with TBP. The Octl POU domain was -______ domain in its + purified as His-fusion protein and compared with the Oct2 POU --+_ ability to interact with TBP. Comparable amounts of TBP co-precipitated with the OctI and the Oct2 POU domains (Figure 3B).

In all previous experiments either in vitro translation lysates or complete nuclear extracts were used as source of proteins. Thus we wanted to rule out the possibility that the interaction required simultaneous interaction of Oct 2 and TBP with DNA or additional proteins. Lai and Herr (42) have recently shown that addition of EtBr will discriminate between bona fide protein-protein interactions and interactions requiring the binding to DNA. Increasing amounts of EtBr were included in the co-precipitation experiments, but there was no effect on the Oct2 -TBP interaction (Figure 4A), suggesting that it is a genuine protein-protein interaction. Identical results were obtained with the Octl POU domain (data not shown). To evaluate the role of additional proteins on Oct-TBP complex formation we tested whether recombinant TBP would be able to directly interact with recombinant Oct2. TBP was expressed as fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and the retention of the labeled Oct2 POU domain on glutathione -Sepharose beads containing either no coupled protein, GST or the GST-TBP fusion protein was tested. The Oct2 POU domain specifically bound to the GST-TBP beads, demonstrating that the specific interaction can be detected with recombinant proteins in the absence of any additional cofactors (Figure 4B). Comparison of TBP derived from several different species had revealed that TBP contains a variable (in length and sequence) species-specific N-terminus and a highly conserved C-terminal core domain. This C-terminal core is required for interaction with DNA and suffices for survival in yeast (43 -45). In order to identify which domain is required for interaction with Oct2, Nand C-terminal truncations of TBP (outlined in Figure 5A) were tested in the co-precipitation assay. All C-terminal deletions failed to interact with Oct2, indicating that the intact C-terminus of the core domain is essential (Figure SB, lanes 7-9). In contrast, the entire N-terminal domain could be deleted (deletion construct 148-339; Figure SB, lane 5) without affecting the interaction with Oct2. Removal of 20 additional amino acids (deletion construct 168-339; Figure SB, lane 3) strongly reduces and further deletion (272-339; Figure SB, lane 4) completely abolishes the interaction with Oct2. The yeast TBP core domain is 80% homologous to the mammalian TBP core domain. Purified and recombinant yeast TBP have been shown to function in mammalian in vitro transcription extracts and confer basal transcriptional activity. As the contact between Oct2 and TBP only requires the core domain it was interesting to determine whether the highly conserved yeast TBP would also interact with Oct2. Co.. precipitation experiments i the presence of BJA-B nuclear extracts showed that yeast TBP interacted with Oct2 as efficiently as the human counterpart (Figure SC).  +  y-TBI  huTBP  _  yTBP  _  1  2  3  4  Figure 5.

'In vivo' interaction of Octl and Oct2 with TBP. (A) Whole cell extracts (500 Ag) from either untransfected Cosl cells or cells transfected with the indicated expression vectors were immunoprecipitated with the Oct2-specific antibody (lanes 1-4) or rabbit pre-immune serum (lane 5). The precipitate was separated on a polyacrylamide gel, transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with a monoclonal antibody specific for TBP (38). The TBP-specific signal is marked. (B) Co-precipitation of endogenous TBP from HeLa nuclear extracts. HeLa nuclear extract (3 mg) was immunoprecipitated with an Octl-specific antibody (lanes 2 and 3) or rabbit pre-immune serum (lane 4) and the precipitate was analyzed for the presence of TBP by Western blotting as above. The nuclear extract used for immunoprecipitation in lane 2 was passed over a DEAE -cellulose column to remove DNA prior to immunoprecipitation with the anti-Octl antibody. In lane 1, 100 1sg of the starting nuclear extract was loaded directly as a control. Positions of TBP and a cross-reactive signal of the primary antibody used for the immunprecipitation (Ig) are indicated.  'In vivo' interaction of TBP with Octl and Oct2 To determine whether the association between TBP and Oct2 could also be detected within cells we overexpressed both proteins ectopically in Cosl cells. Extracts from cells transiently transfected with either Oct2, TBP or both Oct2 plus TBP expression vectors were immunoprecipitated with Oct2-specific antibodies and precipitates were analyzed in Western immunoblots with a monoclonal TBP-specific antibody. Coprecipitated TBP could only be detected upon co-transfection of Oct2 and TBP expression vectors (Figure 6A, lane 4 ). In a control immunoprecipitate with pre-immuneserum, no TBP signal was observed (Figure 6A, lane 5). Likewise, no signals were obtained when the anti-TBP antibody was blocked by pre incubation  with excess recombinant TBP (data not shown). From comparison of the intensities of the TBP signals in the coimmunoprecipitation and the direct TBP immunoblot we estimate that about 2-5% of the TBP present in the transfected cells can be co-precipitated with Oct2. Removal of chromosomal DNA by passing the extract over a DEAE column under high salt conditions did not affect the amount of co-precipitated TBP (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the Oct2 - TBP interaction does not depend on additional B cell-specific proteins and that it can occur under these 'in vivo' conditions. To analyze the interaction of OctI and TBP within cells the endogenous OctI protein was immunoprecipitated from a HeLa nuclear extract under conditions that allow Oct - TBP interactions and analyzed as above. Clearly, the endogenous TBP can be coprecipitated with OctI (Figure 6B). Comparison of the amount of co-precipitated TBP with the total amount of TBP present in the starting HeLa nuclear extract reveals that between 0.1 and 0.3 % of the endogenous TBP co-precipitates with OctI (Figure 6B, lanes 1 and 3). The lower recovery of TBP in this coprecipitation experiment with endogenous proteins as compared to the recovery in the Cos co-transfection experiment is most likely due to the different relative abundancies of the interacting proteins with respect to other endogenous transcription factors. Passing the extract over a DEAE column to remove chromosomal DNA again did not affect the the amount of co-precipitated TBP (Figure 6B, lanes 2 and 3).  Oct2 and TBP cooperate in the transactivation of an octamer promoter The finding that Oct2 and TBP associate both in vitro and in vivo prompted us to investigate the effect of these proteins on octamerdependent transcription in vivo. When a reporter plasmid  Nucleic Acids Research, 1994, Vol. 22, No. 9 1661 containing 4 copies of the octamer motif upstream of the HSV -thymidine kinase TATA box was transfected in the S 194 plasmacytoma cell line a significant octamer-dependent activtiy could be demonstrated (34). Due to the fact that these cells contain very low levels of endogenous Oct2 (32) this activity could be further increased 2- to 3-fold by co-transfection of an Oct2 expression vector (Figure 7, bars 1 and 2). Co-transfection of the same reporter with the TBP expression vector resulted in a 6- to 7-fold stimulation (Figure 7, bar 3). Similarly, when a Nterminal deletion construct of TBP that just contained the conserved core domain was co-transfected (deletion construct 148-339), a 5- to 6-fold stimulation was observed. Whereas Oct2 co-transfection specifically stimulated reporter constructs bearing octamer motifs in their promoter or enhancer elements (32, 34), co-transfection of the TBP expression vector resulted in an activation of a variety of different reporter constructs in S194 cells (data not shown). When both the Oct2 and TBP expression vectors were co-transfected, the stimulation obtained was greater than that of either expression vector alone and even greater than the sum of the two individual stimulations. Rather, co-transfection of Oct2 and TBP resulted in a synergistic activation of the octamer reporter template suggesting that Oct2 and TBP cooperate in vivo (Figure 7, bar 5). Again the same synergistic activation was seen when Oct2 and the core domain of TBP were co-transfected (Figure 7, bar 6). the interaction of p53 with yeast TBP. Whereas no interaction between p53 and yeast TBP was detected in an initial report (46), interaction could be shown in subsequent experiments (47, 48). From all these experiments it is evident that the core domain of TBP is involved in many types of heterophilic protein-protein interactions. Not only does it interact with several other components (TAFs) of the TFIID basal transcription factor, it is also involved in interactions with various upstream activating factors (52). Interestingly, whereas in the case of the viral transactivators and PU. 1 the transactivation domains are involved in direct TBP interaction, Oct2 and OctI contact TBP via their POU domains. The POU domain of Octi, Oct2 as well as of other POU transcription factors is responsible for specific DNA recognition. However, it had also been shown to be involved in several homoand heterophilic protein-protein interactions. Cooperative binding of OctI and Oct2 to neighboring binding sites is mediated by POU domain interactions (53). Likewise the interaction of Octl and Pitl involves the POU domains (54). In addition, the specific interaction between Octl and VP16 depends critically on residues in the first helix of the helix-turn-helix motif of the homeo domain. In the case of the Oct-VP16 interaction, differences between Octl and Oct2 determine a differential capacity to interact with VP16 (55-57). Our result that both POU domains interact with TBP to a similar extent suggests that different parts of the homeo domain are involved in Oct-TBP and Oct-VP16 interactions. Alternatively, the same interaction surface might show different dependencies upon specific amino acid residues for the two types of heterophilic interactions. Different domains of the c-Rel protein that interact with TBP have been identified in the two published reports. Similar to the interaction of TBP with Octl and Oct2, the interaction domain identified in the murine c-Rel protein is also localized within the DNA binding/dimerization domain of the protein (15). In contrast, the TBP interaction domains in the chicken c-Rel protein were identified in the C-terminal transactivation domain of the protein (51). A potential explanation for the differing results could be the fact that the characterized c-Rel proteins came from different species. Co-transfection experiments and mutational analyses have revealed that Oct2 promoter transactivation is critically dependent on at least one of the two transactivation domains present in the amino and carboxy termini of Oct2, respectively (58, 59). This suggests that the Oct2-TBP interaction is not sufficient to mediate efficient transcriptional stimulation under most circumstances. Interestingly, when the octamer motif is positioned in very close proximity (5 bp) to the TATA box, transcriptional stimulation no longer depends on the presence of the Oct2 transactivation domains (58). For such a promoter it was shown that the POU domain of Oct2 was sufficient to confer transactivation in co-transfection experiments. This result is consistent with a model where due to the direct interaction with the POU domain of Oct2, TBP/TFIID is recruited to this promoter. When the distance between the octamer motif and the TATA motif is increased, the interaction between Oct2 and the basal transcriptional machinery has to be stabilized by additional contacts, most likely between the Oct2 activation domains and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (60, 61). In line with these results and in agreement with previously published results (33) we find that recombinant TBP is not sufficient to mediate Oct2-dependent stimulation of transcription in vitro (A.A. and T.W., unpublished results). The result that Oct2 and TBP can individuaBy stimulate  DISCUSSION We have shown that the OctI and Oct2 transcription factors and TBP interact with each other in solution. The fact that Octl and Oct2 proteins generated by in vitro translation and by expression in E.coli interacted with TBP suggests that specific posttranslational modifications of the Oct proteins are not essential for this interaction. The interaction is direct and independent of the presence of additional proteins. The POU-homeo domain of Oct2 is essential and sufficient for the interaction, in the case of the TBP protein the complete C-terminal core domain is required. Although both the POU-homeo domain and the TBP core domain can bind to DNA, the observed interaction between Oct2 and TBP does not depend on simultaneous binding to DNA, as it is not sensitive to EtBr (42). Several viral transcriptional activators have been shown to be able to directly associate with TBP (10-14) and recently the cellular transcription factors p53, PU. 1, c-Rel and RelA have also been shown to interact with TBP (15, 46-51). In case of EIA, Zta, p53 and c-Rel the interaction domains on the transactivators and TBP have been analyzed. Like OctI and Oct2, they all specifically interact with the core domain of TBP, but there are several interesting differences, however. Oct2 and Zta require essentially the complete core domain for the interaction (14), whereas p53 still interacts with a truncated TBP that lacks the 66 C-terminal amino acids (analogous to our mutant construct 1-271) (49). ElA and c-Rel both interact with a short stretch encompassed within 51 amino acids containing a repeat of basic residues (13, 15). It is at present unclear whether the whole core domain serves as an interaction surface for Oct and Zta, or whether the intact tertiary structure of the core domain of TBP is required to expose the interaction domain properly. In contrast to ElA which shows a clear preference for interaction with human TBP over yeast TBP (12), the interaction of Oct2 like that of Zta and VP16 is equally strong with yeast TBP and human TBP. Differing results have been reported for  1662 Nucleic Acids Research, 1994, Vol. 22, No. 9 and in combination cooperate in vivo suggests that both proteins are limiting and that the additional factors necessary are present in excess in these cells. Most likely yeast TBP is unable to recruit these additional factors and therefore fails to cooperate with Oct2 to stimulate transcription in vivo. In summary, the specific interaction with the TATA binding protein appears to be a property shared by several cellular and viral transactivators thus suggesting that this interaction is a critical requirement for mediating transcriptional activation by these proteins. 31.

<BodyText>13.  14. 15.  16.  F1 recipient mice were injected intraperitoneally with the NK1.1 monoclonal antibody PK136 to inhibit Hh barrier rejection (9). Bone marrow of either female BALB/c or C57BLU6 mice was depleted of T cells with monoclonal antibody (mAb) J1j (anti-Thy-1), mAb C3P0 (anti-CD2), mAb RL172 (anti-CD4), and mAb 3.155 (anti-CD8). Approximately 2 x 106 to 4 x 106 bone marrow cells were injected into recipient F1 mice. Four months after the bone marrow reconstitution, one mouse from each of the two bone marrow constructs was killed. Splenocytes were stained for MHC class 11 molecules l-Ed and I-Ab with mAb 14.4.4 [immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a)] and mAb Y-3P (IgG2a), respectively, to confirm complete reconstitution with donor bone marrow. The CT26-NP cell line was produced by infection of CT26 with a Moloney-based defective recombinant retrovirus, provided by E. Gilboa [J. V. Fetten, N. Roy, E. Gilboa, J. Immunol. 147, 2697 (1991)], containing the NP gene from the PR8 influenza strain and a neomycin-resistance gene. Infected cultures were selected in G418 (400 gg/mI). Individual colonies were tested for NP expression by NP mAb staining and lysis by NP + H-2Kd-specific CTL lines. A clone positive for both antibody staining and lysis was chosen for further experiments. Cells (1 x 106 CT26NP + 1 X 106 CT26 wild-type or 1 x 106 CT26NP + 1 x 106 CT26.GM-CSF) were irradiated (50 Gy) and injected subcutaneously in the left flank of the chimeras. Spleens were removed from the mice 2 weeks after the initial immunization, and splenocytes were cultured in vitro with either NP(147-155) peptide or NP(366-374) peptide in the presence of interleukin-2 and splenocytes from a (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 mouse. After a 7-day in vitro incubation, the splenocytes were harvested and plated in triplicate on a 96-well V-bottom microtiter plate at various effector-totarget ratios. Surrogate target cells, P81 5(H-2d) and MC57G(H-2b), were labeled with 51Cr and added to the effector cells (3000 cells/well) in the presence of synthetic NP(1 47-155) peptide (500 pg/mi) or NP(366-374) peptide (50 pg/mI). After 4-hour incubation of the cell mixture at 370C and in 5% C02, the media were harvested and counted on a gamma counter. A. Y. C. Huang et al., unpublished data. B78H1*NP produced a small but measurable titer of transmissible helper virus. Thus, in the case of B78H1*NP, in vivo virus transmission cannot be ruled out as a potential mechanism for NP presentation on host-derived MHC class molecules. In contrast to B78H1.NP, CT26NP did not produce any transmissible helper virus; thus, in vivo virus transmission does not account for the results shown in Fig. 3. A. Huang and D.

As controls, naive female BALB/c (H-2d) mice, BALB/c (H-2d) -- BALB/c x B6 (H-2dxb) chimeric mice, and DBAN2 mice were also injected IP with the same number of live DBA/2 splenocytes.

The proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes is regulated by cytokines that act in combination with signals induced by the engagement of the T cell antigen receptor. A principal cytokine used by T cells during immune responses is IL-2 (1), itself a product of activated T cells. IL-2 also stimulates a number of other cell types, including B cells, monocytes, lymphokine-activated killer cells, natural killer cells, and glioma cells (2). IL-2 interacts with a specific cell surface receptor (IL-2R) that contains at least three subunits, a, 13, and y (3). A number of other cytokines also stimulate the proliferation of T cells, and recent evidence has suggested that the receptors for several of these cytokines include the -y chain of IL-2R (4). We describe a cytokine whose biological activity resembles that of IL-2 and which also uses components of IL-2R. In the course of testing supematants from a simian kidney epithelial cell line, CV-1/EBNA (5), for cytokine activity, it was discovered that these cells produced a soluble factor capable of supporting proliferation of the IL-2-dependent cell line, CTLL (6). The protein responsible for this biological activity was purified from serumfree supernatants of CV-1/EBNA cells by a combination of hydrophobic interaction and anion-exchange chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography Immunex Research and Development Corporation, 51 University Street, Seattle, WA 98101, USA.  19.

(HPLC), and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 1A, bottom). Analysis of the biological activity in the final HPLC fractions (Fig. 1A, top) and in horizontal slices of the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1B) indicated that the activity coincided with a band of approximately 14 to 15 kD. This protein was blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and the NH2-terminal residues were directly sequenced. We used degenerate oligonucleotide primers on the basis of this amino acid sequence and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to clone a 92-base pair (bp) complementary DNA (cDNA) fragment from mRNA of CV-1/EBNA cells. This cloned cDNA fragment was used to probe a plasmid library containing cDNA inserts prepared from mRNA of CV-1/EBNA cells. A full-length cDNA clone was obtained that encodes a 162-amino acid precursor polypeptide containing an unusually long 48-amino acid leader sequence that is cleaved at the experimentally determined NH2-terminus to form the mature protein. The amino acid sequence (Fig. 1C) exhibits no similarity to any protein in GenBank or EMBL databases. However, IL-15 and IL-2 sequences were compared to determine if there might be structural similarities. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of IL-2 (7) consists of a fourhelix bundle, and IL-2 belongs to the helical cytokine family (8). Although the members of this family show no sequence similarity, they show many structural similarities, and IL-15 is no exception. The secondary struc965  SCIENCE * VOL. 264 * 13 MAY 1994  :I 11 11,1:5  l IMWEIRIM. WAM.M  .1  ture prediction for IL-15 shows strong helical moment for regions 1 to 17 and 94 to 112 and supports a four-helix bundle-like structure for this protein. We used the IL-2 structure as a template to build a 3D model of IL-15 with FOLDER, a distance geometry-based homology modeling package (9). The model suggests two disulfide cross-links one of which,  Cys42-Cys88, is analogous to the only disulfide in IL-2. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of a variety of human cell lines identified the IMTLH bone marrow stromal cell line as a source of human IL-15. The simian-derived cDNA was used to probe an IMTLH cDNA library. A single hybridizing clone was isolated that shares 97% sequence identity in the coding region with the simian IL-15 cDNA. The human IL-15 cDNA contains a 316-bp 5' noncoding region preceding an open reading frame of 486 bp and a 400-bp 3' noncoding region. Expression of IL-15 mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis of several human tissues. IL-15 mRNA was most abundant in placenta and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2A), with detectable levels in heart, lung, liver, and kidney. The best sources of IL-15 mRNA so far observed have been adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells [monocyte enriched (PBMCs)J and epithelial and fibroblast cell lines such as CV-1IEBNA and IMTLH. Freshly isolated, uncultured PBMCs (Fig. 2B) also express very low levels of IL-15 mRNA. Activated peripheral blood T cells (PBTs), a rich source of Fig. 2.

Simian IL-15 was expressed in yeast from a cDNA in which the 5' untranslated sequences and the 48-amino acid leader sequence had been removed. Purified recombinant simian IL-15 stimulated the proliferation of CTLL cells (Fig. 3A) and also phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated PBTs (Fig. 3B), in each case to the same extent and with similar potency as IL-2. Both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of PBTs responded to IL-15 after activation with PHA (Fig. 3, C and D). IL-15 was also found to stimulate the proliferation of murine antigen-specific T cell clones, including helper and cytotoxic clones (10) . In addition to stimulating the proliferation of CTLL cells and PBTs, IL-15, like IL-2, induces the generation of cytolytic effector cells in vitro (Fig. 4A). The primary in vitro induction of alloantigenspecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) was measured in mixed leukocyte cultures. Non-antigen-specific lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells were generated in syngeneic cultures of PBMCs. IL- 15 was at   lIII...  S  least  as potent and effective as IL-2 in these assays. The similar biological properties of IL15 and IL-2 suggested that IL-15 might function by inducing the production of IL-2 or by using the same receptor. A neutralizing antibody to IL-2 did not inhibit the induction of LAK cells by IL-15 (Fig. 4B), indicating that IL-15 probably does not function in this assay by inducing IL-2. Furthermore, an antibody to IL-2Ra (antiIL-2Ra) (2A3) failed to inhibit IL-15induced proliferation of PHA-activated  PBMCs (PHA-PBMCs), although this antibody inhibited IL-2-induced proliferation (Fig. 4C). This is further evidence that IL-15 can function in the absence of IL-2. The antibody to IL-2 did, however, inhibit induction of CTLs by IL-15 from resting PBMCs, indicating that under these conditions IL-15 either induces IL-2 or synergizes with the low level of endogenously produced IL-2 to induce functional T cells. To further compare IL-2 and IL-15, we examined the binding of radiolabeled IL-2 and IL-15 to PHA-activated PBMCs (Fig.  Fig. 5.

Scatchard analysis indicated that IL-2 binding to these cells shows the well-known two classes of high- [dissociation constant (Kd) = 1.48 x 10-11 Ml and low-affinity receptors, but IL-15 appears to have only a single high-affinity [Kd = 2.5 x 10-11 M] binding site. The number of IL-15 receptors per cell is very similar to the number of high-affinity IL-2 receptors (573 and 426 sites per cell, respectively). To test whether subunits of IL-2R might participate in IL-15 binding, we measured the ability of IL-15 to inhibit binding of radiolabeled IL-2 to receptors on the human YT cell line (11). The YT cell line was chosen because of the low expression of IL-2Ra on these cells. IL-15 very effectively competes with IL-2 for binding to YT cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that IL-2 and IL-15 share common binding sites on these cells. IL-1 and IL-4, both of which bind to their own sites on YT cells, failed to compete for IL-2 binding. Experiments with blocking monoclonal antibodies confirmed the participation of IL-2R chains in IL-15 binding and function. Whereas the anti-IL-2Ra did not inhibit IL-15-induced proliferation of T cells, antibodies to IL2RP inhibited all activities of IL-15, including the generation of LAK cells and CTLs (Fig. 4B) and the proliferation of PHA-PBMCs (Fig. 4C) and CTLL cells (Fig. 4D). Antibodies to IL-2RP, such as TU27, have been shown to neutralize IL2-dependent T cell proliferation (such as in Fig. 4C) only when combined with antiIL-2Ra (12). These antibodies to IL-2RP consistently inhibit IL-15 more effectively than they inhibit IL-2. In fact, even antibodies like TU 1, which do not inhibit IL-2 under any circumstances (13), will inhibit IL-15, suggesting that IL-15 binds to IL-2RP differently than does IL-2. These data confirm that stimulation by IL-15 requires interaction of IL-15 with components of IL-2R, including IL-2R13 and probably IL-2Ry, but not IL-2Ra. Although some activities are shared by IL-2 and IL-15, there are also differences between the biological effects of the two cytokines. For example, the IL-3-dependent cell line, 32D (14), expresses the complete IL-2R and proliferates vigorously in response to IL-2, but responded poorly or not at all to IL-15 (Fig. 7). These data suggest that IL-15 may use another receptor component not shared by IL-2R and not expressed by 32D cells. Thus, there are likely to be biological activities of IL-15 not shared by IL-2.

PBTs were selected from fresh PBMCs by Erosette formation, and CD4+ and CD8+ subsets were further isolated by antibody affinity to paramagnetic microspheres with magnetic cell sorter (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Sunnyvale, CA). T cells were activated for 72 hours with PHA followed by 24 hours in IL-2-containing medium. T cell blasts were then harvested, washed, and used. Test cultures contained 50,000 T cells per culture or 2000 CTLL cells per culture. Culture medium was supplemented as described [K. Grabstein et al., J. Exp. Med. 163, 1405 (1986)], and 0.5 liCi of [3H]thymidine was added for the last 4 hours of culture. Cells were collected onto glass fiber filters and radioactivity was determined by avalanche gas ionization. 16. PBMCs, prepared from fresh whole blood by Ficoll Hypaque density gradient centrifugation, were activated by culture with PHA as described above for PBTs (15). 17. IL-i5 was purified from 64 liters of supernatant of CV-1/EBNA cells by ultrafiltration (YM-30), hydrophobic chromatography (Phenyl Sepharose CL4B), anion-exchange chromatography (DEAE Sephacel and Mono 0 fast protein liquid chromatography), reversed-phase HPLC (C4, 5 pm) eluted with an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) [D. L. Urdal et al., J. Chromatogr. 296, 171 (1984)], reversed-phase HPLC eluted with an n-propanol gradient in TFA, and SDS-PAGE. 18. Proteins were electroblotted from the SDS gel to a PVDF membrane. The protein band corresponding to the IL-15 activity was cut out, and the sequence of the 33 NH2-terminal residues was determined by Edman degradation. Two degenerate oligonucleotide mixtures encoding all possible codon usages of residues 1 to 6 and the complement of all possible codon usages of residues 26 to 31 (omitting position 3 of Val31) were synthesized. First-strand cDNA synthesized from CV-1/EBNA mRNA was amplified by PCR with the oligonucleotide mixtures as primers. This yielded a 92-bp DNA fragment that was cloned into pBluescript SK. A hybridization probe prepared from this DNA fragment was used to isolate a cDNA clone containing the complete IL-i5 coding region from a cDNA library constructed from CV-1/EBNA mRNA essentially as described [D. M. Anderson et al., Cell 63, 235 (1990)]. 19. A simian IL-i5 probe was prepared by labeling of the purified simian IL-i5 cDNA with random primers. Northern blot analysis with this probe identified the human IMTLH bone marrow-derived stromal cell line as a source of human IL-15 mRNA. Southern (DNA) blots of pools of an IMTLH cDNA library were probed to identify a positive pool and subsequently to isolate a human IL-15 cDNA. 20. A PCR-generated DNA fragment, containing the simian IL-15 coding region minus the 48-amino acid leader sequence, was ligated into a yeast expression vector that directs secretion of the recombinant protein into the yeast medium [V. Price et al., Gene 55, 287 (1987)]. Recombinant IL-15 was purified from the yeast supernatant as described above for the CV-1-derived IL-15 protein, excluding ultrafiltration and ion exchange.

Human PBMCs from one donor (5 x 1 05 per culture) were cultured with irradiated PBMCs (5 x 105 per culture) from either an allogeneic donor (CTL) or from the autologous donor (LAK) in cultures containing various concentrations of either IL-2 or IL-15, or no cytokine. Cultures were done as described [M. B. Widmer et al., J. Exp. Med. 166,1447 (1987)] and harvested after 6 days (LAK) or 7 days (CTL) and assayed for cytolytic activity against 51Cr-labeled targets. The lysis assay contained various numbers of the responding peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured with 1000 labeled targets in 200 pi of medium in V-bottomed wells, and supernatants were collected after 4 hours of incubation. Lytic units were calculated as the inverse of the fraction of the responding culture required to generate 50% (CTL) or 30% (LAK) of the maximum specific 51Cr release. 22.

Enhancer Point Mutation Results in a Homeotic Transformation in Drosophila Mary Jane Shimell, Jeffrey Simon, Welcome Bender, Michael B. O'Connor* In Drosophila, the misexpression or altered activity of genes from the bithorax complex results in homeotic transformations. One of these genes, abd-A, normally specifies the identity of the second through fourth abdominal segments (A2 to A4). In the dominant Hyperabdominal mutations (Hab), portions of the third thoracic segment (T3) are transformed toward A2 as the result of ectopic abd-A expression. Sequence analysis and deoxyribonuclease I footprinting demonstrate that the misexpression of abd-A in two independent Hab mutations results from the same single base change in a binding site for the gap gene Kruppelprotein. These results establish that the spatial limits of the homeotic genes are directly regulated by gap gene products.  The establishment of correct segmental identity in Drosophila melanogaster requires  the proper function and expression of genes located in the antennapedia and bithorax complexes [reviewed in (1-3)]. In the bithorax complex, loss-of-function mutations typically result in transformations of posterior segments toward more anterior fates, whereas the ectopic activation of homeotic genes along the anterior-posterior axis produces  tation gene products (9-15). For example, mutations in the gap gene hunchback (hb) result in an anterior shift of Ubx expression (12), whereas mutations in Kruppel, knirps, and giant cause ectopic activation of Abd-B (13-16). In several cases, incomplete homeotic regulatory elements containing hb  dominant, gain-of-function phenotypes  in  which anterior segments are transformed toward more posterior identities (4-8).

However, as a result of the large size of homeotic regulatory regions (50 to 100 kb), the precise roles of these individual elements within the context of a complete regulatory domain has remained  elusive. We have studied the Hab-1 and Hab-2 mutations, two gain-of-function alleles that ectopically express the abd-A protein (ABD-A). The Hab-1 and Hab-2 alleles were discovered by E. B. Lewis and I. Duncan, respectively, and Lewis has proposed that they likely affect a homeotic regulatory element (4, 15).

																		<Abstract>The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is a transcriptional activator that may be associated with its ability to suppress tumor cell growth. The acidic amino terminus of the p53 protein has been shown to contain this trans-activation activity as well as the domains for mdm-2 and adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein binding. An extensive genetic analysis of this amino-terminal p53 domain has been undertaken using site-specific mutagenesis. The results demonstrate that the acidic residues in the amino terminus of p53 may contribute to, but are not critical for, this trans-activation activity. Rather, the hydrophobic amino acid residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 of human p53 are both required for trans-activation activity, binding to the adenovirus E1B 55-kD protein and the human mdm-2-p53 protein in vitro. In addition, hydrophobic residues Leu-14 and Phe-19 are crucial for the interactions between p53 and human mdm-2 (hdm-2). Hydrophobic residues Trp-23 and Pro-27 are also important for binding to the adenovirus 5 (Ad5) E1B 55-kD protein in vitro. These mutations have no impact on the ability of the p53 protein to bind to a p53-specific DNA element. These results suggest that 2-4 critical hydrophobic residues in the amino-terminal domain of the p53 protein interact with the transcriptional machinery of the cell resulting in transcriptional activation. These very same hydrophobic residues contact the hdm-2 and Ad5 E1B 55-kD oncogene products.</Abstract>

																		<Abstract>The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.</Abstract>

																	<BodyText>The p53 tumour-suppressor protein controls the expression of a gene encoding the p21 cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) regulator. Levels of p21 protein are increased in senescent cells and p21 overexpression blocks the growth of tumour cells. In normal human cells, but not in many tumour cells, p21 exists in a quaternary complex with a cyclin, a CDK, and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21 controls CDK activity, thereby affecting cell-cycle control, whereas PCNA functions in both DNA replication and repair. Here we use simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro to show than p21 directly inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication in the absence of a cyclin/CDK. Furthermore, p21 blocks the ability of PCNA to activate DNA polymerase delta, the principal replicative DNA polymerase. This regulation results from a direct interaction between p21 and PCNA. Thus, during p53-mediated suppression of cell proliferation, p21 and PCNA may be important for coordinating cell-cycle progression, DNA replication and repair of damaged DNA.</BodyText>

																		<Abstract>The transcription factor CREB binds to a DNA element known as the cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE). CREB is activated through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), but precisely how phosphorylation stimulates CREB function is unknown. One model is that phosphorylation may allow the recruitment of coactivators which then interact with basal transcription factors. We have previously identified a nuclear protein of M(r)265K, CBP, that binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of CREB. We have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction and report here that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its carboxy terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts with the basal transcription factor TFIIB through a domain that is conserved in the yeast coactivator ADA-1 (ref. 8). Consistent with its role as a coactivator, CBP augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription of cAMP-responsive genes.</Abstract>

																		<Abstract>HSP27, the unique mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein, is prominently phosphorylated upon activation of a wide variety of cells and has a role in thermotolerance, growth events, and regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, HSP27 is rapidly and prominently phosphorylated in a manner highly correlated with platelet secretion. However, the function of HSP27 and the identity of proteins that interact with HSP27 remain unknown. To identify specific HSP27-protein interactions, a recombinant fusion protein affinity reagent was constructed and used to identify proteins associating with HSP27 from human platelet lysates and erythroleukemia cells. An 84-kDa protein was found to associate specifically with HSP27 and was isolated from platelet lysates, resolved on preparative gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and microsequenced. A 20-amino acid sequence derived from p84 proved identical to amino acids 484-503 of the transglutaminase, platelet Factor XIII. Immunoblotting studies were used to confirm the binding of FXIII from fresh platelet lysates to the HSP27 fusion protein. FXIII also was shown to coprecipitate with HSP27 in immunoprecipitation studies and to colocalize with HSP27 in immunofluorescence studies of intact glass-activated platelets. The data thus demonstrate specific binding of platelet FXIII to HSP27 and suggest that HSP27 may participate in the cellular localization and/or enzymatic regulation of platelet FXIII.</Abstract>

																		<Abstract>Interactions of the Bcl-2 protein with itself and other members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-X-L, Bcl-X-S, Mcl-1, and Bax, were explored with a yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking Bcl-2 family proteins to a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 trans-activation domain. Protein-protein interactions were examined by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having a lacZ (beta-galactosidase) gene under control of a LexA-dependent operator. This approach gave evidence for Bcl-2 protein homodimerization. Bcl-2 also interacted with Bcl-X-L and Mcl-1 and with the dominant inhibitors Bax and Bcl-X-S. Bcl-X-L displayed the same pattern of combinatorial interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins as Bcl-2. Use of deletion mutants of Bcl-2 suggested that Bcl-2 homodimerization involves interactions between two distinct regions within the Bcl-2 protein, since a LexA protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218 mediated functional interactions with a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 1-81 but did not complement a B42 fusion protein containing Bcl-2 amino acids 83-218. In contrast to LexA/Bcl-2 fusion proteins, expression of a LexA/Bax protein was lethal to yeast. This cytotoxicity could be abrogated by B42 fusion proteins containing Bcl-2, Bcl-X-L, or Mcl-1 but not those containing Bcl-X-S (an alternatively spliced form of Bcl-X that lacks a well-conserved 63-amino acid region). The findings suggest a model whereby Bax and Bcl-X-S differentially regulate Bcl-2 function, and indicate that requirements for Bcl-2/Bax heterodimerization may be different from those for Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimerization.</Abstract>

																		<Abstract>Compartmentalization of the type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is maintained by association of the regulatory subunit (RII) with A-Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). In previous studies (Scott, J. D., Stofko, R. E., McDonald, J. R., Comer, J. D., Vitalis, E. A., and Mangili J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21561-21566) we have shown that dimerization of RII alpha was required for interaction with the cytoskeletal component microtubule-associated protein 2. In this report we show that the localization and dimerization domains of RII alpha are contained within the first thirty residues of each RII protomer. RII des-5 (an amino-terminal deletion mutant lacking residues 1-5) was unable to bind AKAPs but retained the ability to dimerize. RII alpha I3A,I5A (a mutant where isoleucines 3 and 5 were replaced with alanine) was unable to bind a variety of AKAPs. Mutation of both isoleucines decreased AKAP binding without affecting dimerization, cAMP binding, or the overall secondary structure of the protein. Measurement of RII alpha I3A,I5A interaction with the human thyroid AKAP, Ht 31, by two independent methods suggests that mutation of isoleucines 3 and 5 decreases affinity by at least 6-fold. Therefore, we propose that two isoleucine side chains on each RII protomer are principle sites of contact with the conserved amphipathic helix binding domain on AKAPs.</Abstract>

																		<Abstract>Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of the insulin receptor and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although IRS-1 is thought to interact with the insulin receptor, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. We demonstrate that IRS-1 forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the insulin receptor is unable to phosphorylate an IRS-1 protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.</Abstract>

The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction. In recent years, extraordinarily rapid advances have been made in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) function. These advances are largely due to the identification of cytosolic proteins which associate with the RTK and transduce signals from the receptor to the interior of the cell. These proteins include phospholipase C-yl, Ras-GTPase-activating protein, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the SH-PTP2 phosphatase (syp), and Grb2 (11, 21, 22, 28, 29, 38). All of these proteins contain Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of approximately 100 amino acids which interact directly with specific phosphotyrosine-containing peptide domains within the RTK (24, 33). The amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphotyrosine moiety (generally only four amino acids) has been shown to be the primary determinant of the specificity of SH2 domain interaction (39). From these data has emerged a general model suggesting that hormone binding induces receptor dimerization, leading to autophosphorylation on tyrosines. This results in the recruitment of SH2-containing effector proteins to the receptor (8, 45). At this point, the effector protein is thought to be activated either by direct receptor phosphorylation or by other, perhaps conformational, changes which occur during this interaction. Alternatively, the receptor interaction might bring the effector protein to the plasma membrane, where it interacts with membrane-specific targets. A similar yet distinct model has been proposed to explain insulin receptor signaling (20, 50). It has been known for almost a decade that stimulation of most cell types with insulin leads to the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a cytosolic protein with an Mr of 165,000 to 185,000 termed pp185 (52).

IRS-1 is a cytoplasmic protein which is rapidly phosphorylated upon multiple tyrosines immediately after insulin receptor autophosphorylation. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 interacts with a variety of SH2-containing proteins, including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Grb2, and SH-PTP2 (syp) (4, 25, 38, 40), although the physiological relevance of these proteins to insulin signaling has not yet been rigorously proven. It is noteworthy that IRS-1 appears to differentiate the insulin receptor from the other classes of RTKs in which the SH2containing proteins interact directly with the receptor. IRS-1 has been shown to be an important component of mitogenic signaling by the insulin receptor (34, 49), but the role of IRS-1 in metabolic signaling has not been clearly demonstrated. IRS-1 appears to interact with the insulin receptor in vivo, since a small amount of IRS-1 can be coimmunoprecipitated with the insulin receptor by using antireceptor antibodies and a small amount of insulin receptor can be coimmunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibodies (4, 41). It is unclear whether this phenomenon represents a direct interaction between the receptor and IRS-1 or involves accessory proteins. Although these studies showed that insulin stimulation of the receptors was required for coimmunoprecipitation, it is unclear whether the insulin receptor must be tyrosine phosphorylated in order to interact with IRS-1. Alternatively, insulin-induced conformational changes of the insulin receptor may be responsible for the interaction. To begin to address these questions, we explored the use of the two-hybrid assay of Fields and Song (15) to detect and measure the interaction between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. These assays allow the measurement of in vivo protein-protein interactions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (10, 15, 18, 53, 54). The two-hybrid assay has been used to study the interaction of a variety of proteins, including 6433  6434  O'NEILL ET AL.  MOL. CELL. BIOL.  the SH3-mediated interaction of Grb2 with SOS, the p2lras interaction with the Rafl kinase, proteins which interact with the transcription factor serum response factor, and c-myc transcriptional partners (9, 12, 46, 54). Here we report the successful use of the two-hybrid assay to study in detail an interaction between human IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. MATERMILS AND METHODS Yeast strains and plasmids. The yeast strain EGY40 (oa trpl ura3-52 his3 leu2) and all yeast expression plasmids were generously provided by the laboratory of Roger Brent. The lexAop-lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18-34, LexA fusion plasmid pEG202, activation domain fusion plasmid pJG4-5, positive control LexA-GAL4 plasmid pSH17-4, and negative control LexA-bicoid plasmid RFHM1 have been previously described (16, 18, 54). The human skeletal muscle IRS-1 cDNA was provided by C. Ronald Kahn, and the amino acid numbering is according to Araki et al. (2). Plasmid construction. The cDNA fusions were produced by a variety of standard methods (3). These included the use of PCR, oligonucleotide linkers, prior shuttling into one or more intermediate vectors, and filling in or removing overhangs to allow the in-frame insertion into the yeast expression vectors. Detailed cloning strategies for each clone are available upon request and will not be presented here. All junctions were sequenced by using customized primers and Sequenase 2.0 sequencing protocols (United States Biochemical Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio), as were all PCR-derived DNAs. The amino acid sequences of the junctions are shown below. The LexA or activation domain amino acids are underlined (the initial E corresponds to the GAA codon in the EcoRI cloning site in both plasmids), the amino acids which encode IRS-1 or the insulin receptor are shown in boldface, and amino acids introduced by linker sequences are shown in normal type. Where appropriate, the restriction enzyme sites used to obtain these fragments are shown in parentheses. Acid blob-IRS-1 fusion sequences were as follows: 21-1242, ELIRCK, (FspI, IRS-1 stop); 45-516, ELIRFE (XhoI, BglII); 516-865, EFDD, (BglII, BamHI); 865-1242, EFDD, (BamHI, IRS-1 stop); 108516, ERQ, (KpnI, BglII); 160-516, ELEFPF, (BsmI, BglII); 203-516, EFRA, (EagI, BglII); 258-516, ELEFR, (SfiI, BglII); 45-456, ELIRFE, (XhoI, SacII); 45-400, ELIRFE, (XhoI, NcoI); 45-256, ELIRFE, (XhoI, SfiI); 160-456, ELEFPF, (BsmI, SacII); and 160-400, ELEFPF, (BsmI, NcoI). The sequence of the LexA-insulin receptor fusion, 941-1343, was EFPGIRRHTRMHHHHHHDDDDKR. This Arg-941 residue from the insulin receptor refers to the first amino acid after the transmembrane domain. The insulin receptor numbering is according to Ullrich et al. (44). The receptor hybrid also contains a histidine tag and enterokinase cleavage consensus which was originally used for affinity purification of the cytoplasmic domain in unrelated experiments. The insulin receptor K1018A and Y960F mutations were made by sitedirected mutagenesis using standard protocols (26). All mutants were sequenced prior to use. For the IRS-1 acid blob fusion proteins which do not contain the IRS-1 stop codon, the stop codons are provided by the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase terminator sequences downstream of the polylinker. We noted some minor discrepancies in the predicted sizes of some of the IRS-1 hybrids (see Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 8). The reasons for this are unclear, although it seems likely that it is a reflection of the well-known anomalous behavior of IRS-1, which runs at -180 kDa despite a predicted molecular mass of -135 kDa. Maintenance and transformation of yeast strains. All routine growth and maintenance of yeast strains were as described  elsewhere (17). Plasmid transformation of yeast strains was either by the lithium acetate method (36) or by electroporation  -Galactosidase assays. The colony color 3-galactosidase assay was performed as described previously (6) except that nylon filters were first immersed in liquid nitrogen for 5 s to permeabilize the cells. Filters were then air dried and laid onto Whatman 3MM paper which was saturated with Z buffer-5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-,3-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) solution (6). Colony color assays were performed on at least five independent colonies from each hybrid. The solution 3-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (7), and the units of P-galactosidase activity were calculated by the method of Miller (31). Solution assays for the positive colonies were performed on at least two independent colonies, and the numbers within an experiment varied less than 10% between colonies. The values shown for the positive colonies represent averages of four assays (two independent colonies performed in duplicate). For the negative colonies, the numbers represent averages of two assays (single colony performed in duplicate). Immunoblot analysis of hybrid protein expression. Overnight cultures of plasmid-containing yeast cells were grown in selective medium with 2% glucose. The following day, the cultures were pelleted, washed in sugar-free medium, diluted 1:50 into fresh selective medium with either 2% glucose or 2% galactose, and grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 1.0 to 1.3. At this point, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (27). The proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose (43), and the activation domain hybrid proteins were detected by using an antihemagglutinin antibody (3) and the ECL detection system (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.). The insulin receptor hybrids were detected by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody IR CT-1 (a gift from Ken Siddle). The phosphotyrosine blot was performed with antibody PY20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, Ky.). COS cell expression studies. The entire IRS-1 cDNA was transferred to the pECE mammalian expression vector (13). The A45-515 mutant was constructed by insertion of a linker between the XhoI and BglII sites in order to maintain the correct reading frame. These expression plasmids were used to transfect COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran procedure (3). The IRS-1 plasmids were cotransfected with an insulin receptor expression plasmid (13). On the day after transfection, the cells were split into two plates and allowed to grow for 48 h. At this point, the cells were treated for 10 min with phosphatebuffered saline supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin with or without 100 nM insulin. After 10 min at 37°C, the medium was removed and the cells were scraped into 300 RI of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The cell lysates were boiled for 10 min and briefly sonicated. Duplicate 7.5% gels were loaded with 30 RI of sample, and following electrophoresis, proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose and analyzed with the ECL detection system (Amersham), using either an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (PY20; Transduction Laboratories) or an antibody against the carboxy terminus of IRS-1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, N.Y.). RESULTS The two-hybrid assay demonstrates specific interaction of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor. To test the utility of the two-hybrid assay in the measurement of an interaction between the insulin receptor and IRS-1, we used the interaction trap system (18, 54), a modified version of the two-hybrid  (5).

These assays are based upon the finding that transcription factors contain separable functional modules which direct either DNA binding or transcriptional activation. The cDNA of the protein of interest is used to make a fusion with a DNA-binding domain from a known DNA-binding protein such as LexA. These DNA-binding hybrids cannot activate transcription since they do not contain a transcriptional activation domain. A second protein suspected to interact with the first protein is fused to a known transcriptional activation domain such as an acid blob domain. This hybrid protein can activate transcription but cannot by itself interact with DNA. Both of these hybrid proteins are expressed in yeast cells. The DNA-binding bait hybrid interacts with the DNA at specific sequences located upstream of a marker gene such as lacZ, whose protein product, ,B-galactosidase, can be easily assayed. If the second activation domain hybrid associates with the bait hybrid within the nucleus, the activation domain is held in the vicinity of the promoter and transcription of the marker gene is activated. To construct the bait hybrid protein, we fused the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor to the DNA-binding region of LexA. This hybrid contains the LexA DNA-binding domain at the amino terminus followed by the entire cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor (amino acids 941 to 1343 according to Ullrich et al. [44]). To produce the second hybrid, we fused amino acids 21 to 1242 of human IRS-1 (all but the first 20 amino acids) to the acidic activation domain. At its amino terminus, this IRS-1 hybrid protein contains the simian virus 40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal, the influenza virus HAl epitope tag, and the B42 acidic transcriptional activation domain, which is also referred to as an acid blob domain (18,54), followed by the IRS-1 sequences. A schematic of these hybrid proteins is shown in Fig. 1A. Plasmids expressing these hybrid proteins were introduced into yeast strain EGY40 along with the leTAop-lacZ reporter plasmid, and transformants were identified by growth on the proper selective media. These colonies were first analyzed by the colony filter assay for ,B-galactosidase activity (6) after replica plating onto selective plates containing either glucose or galactose (in order to induce the galactose-specific expression of the IRS-1 fusions) (18). Since the GAL promoter is repressed by glucose and induced by galactose, 13-galactosidase activity should be observed only when the yeast cells are grown in the presence of galactose. As summarized in Fig. 1B, no 3-galactosidase activity was observed when the insulin receptor hybrid was expressed independently of the IRS-1 hybrid, regardless of the carbon source. Conversely, when the IRS-1 hybrid was coexpressed with the insulin receptor bait, blue colonies were observed, but only when cells were grown on galactosecontaining plates. To ensure that the IRS-1 hybrid was not interacting with the LexA portion of the bait, it was coexpressed with a second bait hybrid protein which contains the identical LexA domain fused to a portion of the Drosophila bicoid protein (54). No 3-galactosidase activity was observed with this combination, demonstrating that the IRS-1 hybrid does not interact with the LexA portion of the bait hybrid. In addition, this result shows that the IRS-1 hybrid cannot induce ,B-galactosidase activity by itself. To better quantitate 3-galactosidase activity, solution assays were performed with cell lysates from cells grown in either glucose or galactose. As shown in Fig. 1B, these results confirmed those obtained from the colony color filter assay. Coexpression of the IRS-1 and insulin receptor hybrids resulted in an approximately 100-fold increase in activity when cells were grown in galactose. Both assays of ,B-galactosidase activity showed clear and reproducible differences between glucose- and galactose-grown cells.

IRS-1 interacts specifically with the insulin receptor in the two-hybrid assay. (A) Schematic representation of the hybrid proteins. The entire cytoplasmic domain of the human insulin receptor (IR) was fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (DBD). The cDNA encoding amino acids 21 to 1242 of IRS-1 was fused to the acid blob activation domain. Interaction of these hybrid proteins would be expected to drive the expression of the lexAop-lacZ reporter gene. (B) The insulin receptor hybrid and the lexAop-lacZ reporter were introduced into yeast cells in the absence or presence of the IRS-1 hybrid and transformants were isolated on selective plates. Transformants were assayed for 13-galactosidase (1-Gal) activity by either the colony color or the solution assay as described in Materials and Methods. As a negative control, the IRS-1 21-1242 hybrid was coexpressed with the LexA-bicoid hybrid. As a positive control, the GAL4 activation domain-LexA hybrid was coexpressed with the lexAop-lacZ reporter. The colony color assay showed either white (-) or dark blue (++ + +) colonies.  compare the activity that we observed to that of a known activator of the lexAop-lacZ reporter, we expressed a LexAGAL4 fusion protein which is known to induce high-level activity. The hybrid LexA-GAL4 protein is constitutively expressed and gives high activity when grown on glucose or galactose (18). The activity generated by the insulin receptor interaction with IRS-1 was consistently 30 to 40% of the level observed with the positive control. Considering that the LexAGAL4 hybrid is monomeric and that the GAL4 activation domain is generally considered to be a stronger transcriptional activator than the acid blob domain in our constructs (18), it appears that the 1-galactosidase activity generated by the insulin receptor interaction with IRS-1 is quite high. We conclude that IRS-1 forms a specific interaction with the insulin receptor in the yeast nucleus which can be easily measured in the two-hybrid system, using either the colony color or the solution assay to measure ,B-galactosidase activity. Insulin receptor kinase activity is essential for IRS-1 interaction. We next sought to determine whether the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor was important for the interaction with IRS-1. In this regard, mutation of the critical lysine (K-1018) within the ATP-binding motif of the insulin receptor has been shown to eliminate receptor activity and IRS-1 phosphorylation (20). It is unclear whether this receptor mutation has any effect upon the interaction with IRS-1 or whether this mutant receptor simply cannot phosphorylate IRS-1. To test these possibilities in the two-hybrid system, we mutated Lys-1018 to Ala within the insulin receptor-LexA bait hybrid by site-directed mutagenesis. To be sure that the receptor ATP-binding mutant (termed the AK mu 6436  O'NEILL  ET AL.  MOL. CELL. BIOL.  A  IRBlait: ~ IR  :  C  4  3  e~~;  _  ib,  Blot  Ab:  IR  CT1-I  PY20  B  type receptor. These results would be predicted from previous studies done with higher eukaryotic cells in which this same mutation was introduced into the intact insulin receptor (51). We next tested the ability of the Y960F receptor hybrid to interact with the IRS-1 21-2142 hybrid in the two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, this mutant receptor showed no interaction with IRS-1. Our data provide direct support for the widely held theory that the juxtamembrane domain, and specifically Tyr-960, forms a part of the IRS-1 binding site and, together with the ATP-binding receptor mutant data, suggest that receptor autophosphorylation of Tyr-960 is essential for this  I'lasmids LexA  Colony (olor :-Gal Activitv {7 GLU GA  interaction. Identification of a region of IRS-1 which is important for interaction with the insulin receptor. Having demonstrated the utility of the two-hybrid assay in accurately reproducing an interaction between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor, we were interested in delineating the region of IRS-1 which interacts with the insulin receptor. We therefore expressed a series of relatively large regions of IRS-1 as activation hybrids and examined whether they interacted with the insulin receptor in the two-hybrid assay. These constructs and their locations relative to full length IRS-1 are shown schematically in Fig. 3A. We found that a region bordered by amino acids 45 and 516 was sufficient for receptor interaction and that sequences C terminal of amino acid 516 showed little or no interaction with the insulin receptor. As a further test, we expressed a 516-1242 hybrid as well as two hybrids which contained deletions within the 45-516 region. All of these constructs showed little activity. To examine whether the low levels of activity of the 516-865, 865-1242, 516-1242, and the two deletion hybrids were not simply due to decreased expression, we examined their galactose-inducible expression by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3B, when cell lysates were immunoblotted with the hemagglutinin antibody, all seven hybrids were found to be expressed in a strictly galactose inducible manner at roughly similar levels. We conclude that the hybrid protein containing amino acids 45 to 516 is sufficient for receptor interaction and that other domains of IRS-1 show much less interaction with the receptor despite high-level protein expression. Our finding that the three hybrids which contain the 516-1242 region show slight activity in the colony filter assay suggests that this region of IRS-1 may also contain a weaker domain of interaction. To further delineate the region of IRS-1 which interacts with the insulin receptor, we assayed nine constructs within the 45-516 region for receptor interaction. Amino-terminal deletions suggest that amino acids between 160 and 203 are critical for interaction. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 4A, the 108-516 and 160-516 hybrids showed dark blue colonies and high-level 3-galactosidase activity which was generally comparable to that of the parental 45-516 hybrid. The 45-516 hybrid gave consistently higher activities than did the 108-516 and 160-516 hybrids, yet it is unclear whether this is significant. It is therefore possible that the 45-108 region contributes to the interaction. Further deletion of either amino acids 160 to 203 or 160 to 258 eliminated activity, suggesting that an essential component of interaction is located between amino acids 160 and 203. The C-terminal boundary of interaction appears to be somewhat more complex, as demonstrated by C-terminal deletions. One element which is required for high-level activity appears to be located between amino acids 456 and 516, since deletion of amino acids 457 through 516 or 401 through 516 showed much reduced (-90 to 95%) though significant activity. By itself, this element is totally inactive and appears to require the 160-203 essential region, as shown by the lack of activity of the 203-516 and 258-516 hybrids.

As shown in Fig. 2A, the AK mutant showed levels of expression similar to those of the wild-type receptor by immunoblotting with the antireceptor antibody IR-CT1. Despite similar levels of expression, the AK mutant showed no tyrosine phosphorylation compared with the wild-type receptor, as demonstrated by immunoblotting a duplicate blot with the antiphosphotyrosine antibody PY20. We next tested whether the 21-1242 IRS-1 hybrid interacted with this AK mutant receptor in the two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, the AK receptor mutant showed no significant interaction with the IRS-1 hybrid. Importantly, these data also demonstrate that the wild-type receptor cytoplasmic domain retains the ability to undergo autophosphorylation when expressed as a hybrid in yeast nuclei and show directly, for the first time, that receptor kinase activity is essential for IRS-1 interaction. Tyrosine 960 within the receptor juxtamembrane domain is essential for IRS-1 interaction. Mutations within the receptor juxtamembrane domain have been shown to greatly decrease IRS-1 phosphorylation (51). Although this region of the receptor has been postulated to be the site of IRS-1 interaction, this has not been shown directly. To address this question, we mutated Tyr-960 to Phe in the receptor hybrid. As shown in Fig. 2A, this receptor mutant showed levels of expression similar to those of the wild-type receptor. The Y960F mutant receptor retained the ability to autophosphorylate, although with decreased total phosphorylation compared with the wild VOL.  14, 1994 A  IRS-1 INTERACTION WITH THE INSULIN RECEPTOR  6437  A  Pleckstrin  ATP  lomology Binding Domain Site (13-115)4141.161) I  100as 1242  ml;r;UPU IUHuman IRS-I I __ 21-1242  v  _ l  Colony p-GAL Activity Color GLU GAL 209 ++++ 2 2 2 2 2 2 2  1  45-516  1 516-365  1 865-1242  516-1242  al 1  21-1242-(A 45-515) 21-1242-(A 159-515)  ++++ (+) (+) 1 m (+)  484 2 3 5 4 6 Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  B  20097 46  am  aqo I .... 4  30-  1  2345 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 FIG. 3.

The smallest peptide within this region which retained significant activity included amino acids 160 through 400. These experiments suggest that this insulin receptor-binding element of IRS-1 is composed of multiple interdependent components which mediate the interaction in a combinatorial manner. To rule out the possibility that the differences in activity were due to differences in levels of protein expression, we examined the expression of the IRS-1 hybrids by immunoblotting as described above. As shown in Fig. 4B, all of the IRS-1 activation domain fusions were expressed. The proteins were generally of the sizes predicted (Fig. 4B), and all showed galactose inducibility (data not shown). It appeared that all hybrid proteins were being properly expressed, and expression levels appeared to be generally similar. These experiments demonstrate that the fragments which showed no activity in the two-hybrid assay (203-516 and 258-516; Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4) are expressed at high levels. It is therefore likely that the negative results in the two-hybrid assay are due to the inability of these hybrids to interact with the insulin receptor. All of the hybrids showed numerous bands when immunoblotted, pre sumably  as a result of proteolytic degradation. The proteolysis is perhaps not surprising, since the yeast cells are grown for relatively long times (18 to 24 h) prior to extract preparation, and may therefore simply represent normal protein turnover. This proteolysis does not appear to affect the interaction, since there is no correlation between degree of proteolysis and lack of activity. Deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 eliminates IRS-1 phosphorylation by the insulin receptor in COS cells. To test further our assertion that amino-terminal sequences of IRS-1 mediate the interaction with the insulin receptor, we used a COS cell transient expression system. We reasoned that if this region of IRS-1 was important for receptor interaction, a mutant IRS-1 molecule containing a deletion of this region should be a relatively poor insulin receptor substrate. We therefore cotransfected COS cells with vectors designed to coexpress the insulin receptor with either the full-length IRS-1 or a deletion mutant IRS-1 from which amino acids 45 to 515 had been deleted (Fig. 5A). We then examined whether these IRS-1 proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosines in response to insulin treatment of the cells. As shown in Fig. SB, the insulin receptor transfectants showed a high level of insulindependent receptor autophosphorylation by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting (top, lanes 2, 4, and 6) compared with  6438  O'NEILL ET AL.

Deletion of amino acids 45 to 515 of IRS-1 eliminates phosphorylation by the insulin receptor in COS cells. (A) Schematic of full-length (wild-type [wt]) and deleted IRS-1 cDNAs used for expression in COS cells. (B) COS cells were transfected with expression plasmids for the insulin receptor (IR) and/or the IRS-1 plasmids as indicated at the top. Duplicate plates were treated with 0 or 100 nM insulin as shown, and lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with either an antiphosphotyrosine (a-P-Tyr) or anti-IRS-1 (oa-IRS-1) antibody as described in Materials and Methods. Lanes 7 and 8 represent mock-transfected cells. Locations of the insulin receptor (IR) and wild-type IRS-1 (IRS-1-WT) proteins are shown by the arrows. Sizes are indicated in kilodaltons.  both IRS-1 expression constructs showed high-level expression of proteins of the predicted molecular weight. The IRS-1 deletion protein ran considerably more slowly than the insulin receptor, and the lack of tyrosine phosphorylation is therefore not a result of comigration with the receptor. Longer exposures do not reveal any phosphorylation of a band corresponding to the IRS-1 deletion mutant (data not shown). These results suggest that the amino-terminal region of IRS-1 is required for efficient interaction with the insulin receptor in higher eukaryotic cells and is not simply an artifact of the two-hybrid assay in yeast cells.  DISCUSSION Since IRS-1 is likely to be an important mediator of at least of the effects of the insulin receptor, the regulation of the interaction between the receptor and IRS-1 is of primary importance to insulin signaling. In this paper, we report the successful use of the two-hybrid assay in S. cerevisiae to detect and begin to characterize the interaction between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. Since this assay has not been used previously to study interactions of proteins with active tyrosine kinases, it was critical to first demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor could be expressed in yeast cells in a properly folded, enzymatically active form. Our demonstration that the wild-type and Y960F receptor hybrids retain the ability to autophosphorylate on tyrosines (Fig. 2) shows that the hybrid proteins are properly processed and are enzymatically active in yeast cells. We hypothesize that the some  mock-transfected cells (lane 8). When coexpressed with the insulin receptor, the full-length IRS-1 protein was phosphorylated upon tyrosines at a level significantly above that of endogenous IRS-1 (compare lane 4 with lane 2). Conversely, when the IRS-1 A45-516 deletion was coexpressed, no tyrosine phosphorylation of a band corresponding to the mutant IRS-1 protein was observed (lane 6) despite normal insulin receptor autophosphorylation. To be sure that the two IRS-1 proteins were being expressed at similar levels, a duplicate blot was analyzed with an anti-IRS-1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5B,  VOL. 14, 1994  IRS-1 INTERACTION WITH THE INSULIN RECEPTOR  6439  autophosphorylation may be due in part to the fact that the LexA portion of the hybrid binds to the DNA as a dimer, and thus the receptors have the opportunity to autophosphorylate in an intermolecular manner. Our demonstration that mutations within the ATP-binding and juxtamembrane domains of the insulin receptor which are known to interfere with IRS-1 phosphorylation in vivo also show no interaction with IRS-1 in our yeast system argues strongly that the interaction which we are able to measure in the yeast system is similar to that which occurs in higher eukaryotic cells. In further support of this argument, we show (Fig. 5) that deletion of the interacting domain of IRS-1 identified in S. cerevisiae (amino acids 45 to 515) eliminates IRS-1 phosphorylation by the insulin receptor in COS cells. Since the majority of the tyrosines which undergo insulin receptor-mediated phosphorylation are located between amino acids 516 and 1242 (40), it is unlikely that the lack of phosphorylation of this mutant is due the deletion of tyrosines. We conclude from these data that the two-hybrid system accurately reconstitutes at least one interaction between the receptor and IRS-1 and is thus a valid model for further study. It has been shown that a small amount of IRS-1 can be coimmunoprecipitated from cell lysates by using antireceptor antibodies and likewise that a small amount of insulin receptor can be coimmunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibodies under mild conditions (4, 41). It cannot be determined from this type of study whether the interaction is direct or is mediated by accessory proteins. Our data suggest that at least one interaction between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor is direct, although we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that this interaction is mediated by endogenous yeast proteins. This seems unlikely, since yeasts have not been reported to contain signaling systems such as the insulin receptor or IRS-1 and thus would not be expected to express accessory proteins which might be involved in this interaction. In addition, even if such accessory proteins do exist in S. cerevisiae, it is unlikely that they would be localized to the nucleus. We speculate that the interaction between the insulin receptor and IRS-1 is not as stable as that which occurs between RTKs and SH2 domain-containing proteins. In this regard, using insulin soluble cytoplasmic domain receptor as probes, we were unable to demonstrate a clear interaction with blotted IRS-1, whereas we were able to easily demonstrate interaction of the insulin receptor probes with blotted SH2 domain-containing p85 proteins (data not shown). Perhaps the interaction with IRS-1 has a lower affinity or a higher off-rate compared with SH2 interactions, or this interaction may be sensitive to the detergents commonly used in immunoprecipitations and filter blot assays. In this regard, the two-hybrid assay may be more sensitive than other assays, since theoretically it is not necessary that an interaction be maintained for an extended period of time because even transient interactions should allow transcriptional initiation of the reporter gene. It has been proposed that the juxtamembrane domain of the insulin receptor is the site of IRS-1 interaction, since mutations within this domain eliminate phosphorylation of IRS-1 without significantly affecting autophosphorylation of the remainder of the receptor (19, 35, 51). Specifically, deletions within the juxtamembrane domain or mutation of Tyr-960 to Phe eliminated IRS-1 phosphorylation (19, 51). These results suggest that Tyr-960, which is phosphorylated in vivo (14), may be involved in IRS-1 interaction. Our data provide support for the theory that the juxtamembrane domain is involved in a direct interaction with IRS-1 and furthermore that phosphorylated Tyr-960 is critical for this interaction. Interestingly, these findings are consistent with an SH2 interaction, yet IRS-1 does  not contain a recognizable SH2 domain. It will be interesting to determine if IRS-1 contains a distinct SH2-like motif which can also recognize phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. In this regard, it is interesting that the critical amino acids (in addition to the phosphotyrosine) which determine the specificity of SH2 interaction are thought to be located within the first three or four amino acids on the C-terminal side of the tyrosine (24, 33). Conversely, the NPXY motif contains conserved residues on the N-terminal side of the tyrosine. Thus, it is possible that IRS-1 contains a motif which recognizes phosphotyrosinecontaining peptides in a manner reminiscent of SH2 domains yet recognizes slightly different sequences. In addition to our contention that IRS-1 may interact directly with the juxtamembrane domain, it is equally possible that phosphorylation of Tyr-960 alters the conformation of the insulin receptor in such a way to allow IRS-1 to interact. It has recently been shown that the interleukin 4 (IL-4) receptor appears to mediate at least some of its effects via the tyrosine phosphorylation of an IRS-1-like molecule termed 4PS (48). These two proteins appear to share similar functions, since expression of IRS-1 has been shown to confer IL-4 responsiveness upon a normally nonresponsive cell line, 32D, which does not express 4PS (47). The 4PS protein appears to be a related but distinct gene product, since the majority of anti-IRS-1 antibodies do not recognize 4PS. The signaling component of the IL-4 receptor contains an NPXY sequence motif surrounding Tyr-497, which is very similar to the motif found in the insulin receptor, and it has been demonstrated to be critical for 4PS/IRS-1 phosphorylation in response to IL-4 (23). Furthermore, a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing this NPXY domain from the IL-4 receptor retains the ability to coprecipitate a small amount of 4PS/IRS-1 from cell lysates. It is not clear from these studies whether phosphorylation of Tyr-497 was required for this effect. Our data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-497 of the IL-4 receptor via an intermediate Src-like kinase may provide a binding site for 4PS which is analogous to that which we have demonstrated for the insulin receptor. The demonstration that multiple IRS-1-like proteins exist and that they appear to interact with unrelated receptor types in a similar manner suggests that this type of protein-protein interaction may be a general phenomenon. We show that the interaction with the insulin receptor can be mediated by a domain of IRS-1 located between amino acids 45 and 516. Deletion analysis of this region suggests that between amino acids 160 and 516 there are two important elements of interaction, located between amino acids 160 and 203 and between amino acids 456 and 516. The 160-203 domain appears to be absolutely critical for the interaction. The 456-516 domain appears to account for &amp;gt;90% of the activity observed, but its deletion does not entirely eliminate activity. Both domains appear to be necessary for high-level activity. Although the deletion analysis (Fig. 4) seems to clearly delineate the boundaries of the domain of interaction, we cannot rule out the possibility that structural differences between the hybrids account for some of the differences in activity. For example, certain deletions which contain a good insulin receptor interaction domain may be misfolded and therefore give artificially low activities. In this regard, our conclusions regarding the delineation of the boundaries and subdomains of interaction are strengthened by the fact that in most cases there are at least two hybrids which show similar activities. For example, the finding that the 45-456, 45-400, 160-456, and 160-400 hybrids show similar low levels of activity, compared with the four hybrids (21-1242, 45-516, 108-516, and 160-516), which show high levels of activity, serves to highlight  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  6440  O'NEILL ET AL.  MOL. CELL. BIOL.  the importance of the 456-516 domain. Likewise, the finding that the 203-516 and 258-516 hybrids show good protein expression yet are completely negative in the two-hybrid assay suggests that the lack of ,B-galactosidase activity is due to a lack of interaction with the insulin receptor. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain located between amino acids 13 and 115 is a putative domain of protein-protein interaction of unknown function which has recently been identified in a variety of proteins involved in signaling (30, 32, 37). Our data suggest that this domain is not necessary for interaction with the insulin receptor in the two-hybrid assay. In addition to the data shown in Fig. 3 and 5, we have observed no activity of an IRS-1 (1-121) hybrid containing the entire PH domain (data not shown), suggesting that the PH domain is not sufficient for activity in our assay. Nevertheless, since this region may be somehow constrained by its direct fusion to the activation domain sequences, it is possible that this domain is involved in receptor interaction. Alternatively, the PH domain may be involved in interactions with other cellular proteins which help to mediate receptor interaction or signaling. We have begun to examine the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRS-1 hybrid proteins expressed in yeast cells. In preliminary experiments (not shown), we have observed tyrosine phosphorylation of many of the IRS-1 hybrids in yeast cells, irrespective of whether the hybrids showed activity in the two-hybrid assay. This is apparently due to the overexpression of a constitutively active receptor kinase combined with longterm high-level expression of the IRS-1 hybrids. During the -24 h of galactose induction of the IRS-1 hybrids, the kinase is able to phosphorylate these hybrids. This phosphorylation of IRS-1 hybrids is not surprising, since the many YXXM motifs within IRS-1 are excellent substrates of the insulin receptor. Phosphorylation of the IRS-1 hybrids probably occurs throughout the nucleus and to some extent in the cytoplasm, since the majority of the receptor hybrids would not be bound to the few operators on the reporter plasmids. It is therefore important to note that tyrosine phosphorylation of a substrate is not necessarily a reflection of a stable interaction with the receptor, especially in artificial systems such as this in which substrates and receptors are overexpressed. We hypothesize that in addition to the IRS-1 sequence-dependent interaction which we are able to measure with the two-hybrid assay, interactions also occur with the constitutively activated kinase which are sequence independent and result in phosphorylation of the IRS-1 hybrids. These interactions may be analogous to the phosphorylation of short synthetic tyrosine-containing peptides such as poly(Glu-Tyr)4:1 by the insulin receptor. These synthetic peptides are excellent receptor substrates in vitro yet almost certainly do not contain specific motifs which would direct interaction with a particular RTK. It is notable that these sequence-independent interactions do not appear to give any significant activity in the two-hybrid assay, and thus the sequence-dependent interactions such as that involving IRS-1 amino acids 45 to 516 may represent a more stable interaction. In this regard, it is perhaps surprising that we did not observe phosphorylation of the IRS-1 A45-515 hybrid in COS cells (Fig. 5). We hypothesize that during the limited time in which the insulin receptor is activated in these experiments (10 min), the deletion mutant is unable to efficiently interact with the receptor whereas the full-length IRS-1 interacts either more efficiently or more stably, thus allowing phosphorylation to occur. Further experiments will be required to fully examine these issues. It is unclear whether alterations of the interaction between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor may be involved in disease states such as diabetes and insulin resistance. Interestingly, one  MY-P  2  45.516  CT IEffector Protein 51 Cellular Effects -.i  IRS-1  FIG. 6. Model of insulin receptor signaling via IRS-1. In this model, insulin stimulates receptor (IR) autophosphorylation, which phosphorylates Tyr-960 within the juxtamembrane domain. Phosphorylation of this tyrosine results in the direct interaction with the domain of IRS-1 encompassed by amino acids 45 to 516. This interaction may allow the proper presentation of IRS-1 to the receptor kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation of IRS-1 on multiple tyrosines. These phosphotyrosines within IRS-1 would then interact with SH2-containing effector proteins, resulting in their activation.  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  mutation of IRS-1 within the region of interaction that we have delineated which appears to have a greater prevalence in type II diabetics has been identified. Specifically, an amino acid polymorphism (Ala-512 to Pro) was found in IRS-1; 7% of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were found to be heterozygous for this mutation, compared with 2.6% of normoglycemic controls (1). This mutation falls within the carboxyl end of the region, which we propose to be important for interaction with the insulin receptor. Whether this mutation has any functional consequences to insulin signaling is unclear. Our data suggest a model for insulin receptor signaling via IRS-1, which is shown schematically in Fig. 6. In this model, the insulin-activated receptor autophosphorylates Tyr-960 as part of the autophosphorylation cascade in an intermolecular manner. This phosphorylation would then direct the interaction of the receptor with the amino terminus of IRS-1. This interaction might then allow the proper presentation of IRS-1 to the already activated insulin receptor kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation of IRS-1 on a number of tyrosines. These phosphotyrosines on IRS-1 could then interact with SH2-containing effector proteins such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Grb2 and presumably continue the signaling processes. It is notable that the tyrosines of IRS-1 which appear to be phosphorylated by the insulin receptor and subsequently interact with SH2-containing molecules such as p85 (Tyr-612 and Ty-941), SH-PTP2 (syp) (Tyr-1169), and Grb2 (Tyr-896) appear to be primarily located C-terminal of the region that we have localized (38, 40). The precise molecular nature of the IRS-1-insulin receptor interaction remains undefined, yet we can conclude that the ATP-binding motif located at positions 141 to 161 is not required for receptor interaction, since its deletion had no effect on activity. Cursory examination of the protein sequence within the 45-516 domain did not reveal any significant homology to any known proteins in the protein databases. We conclude that this domain mediates a previously uncharacterized type of protein-protein interaction. The two-hybrid assay should provide a straightforward means to further characterize this interaction, particularly by random-point mutagenesis,  VOL. 14, 1994  IRS-1 INTERACTION WITH THE INSULIN RECEPTOR  6441  since mutants which do not interact should be easily discernible in the colony color assay.

<BodyText>Published November 1, 1994  Making a Connection: Direct Binding between Keratin Intermediate Filaments and Desmosomal Proteins P a n o s D. Kouklis, Elizabeth H u t t o n , a n d Elaine F u c h s Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637  Abstract. In epidermal cells, keratin intermediate filaments connect with desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has been implicated in this interaction, although most studies have been conducted with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplaldn and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail" of DPI associates directly with the amino terminal "head" of type II epidermal keratins, including K1, K2, K5, and K6. We  have engineered and purified recombinant K5 head and DPI tail, and we demonstrate direct interaction in vitro by solution-binding assays and by ligand blot assays. This marked association is not seen with simple epithelial type II keratins, vimentin, or with type I keratins, providing a possible explanation for the greater stability of the epidermal keratin filament architecture over that of other cell types. We have identified an 18-amino acid residue stretch in the K5 head that is conserved only among type II epidermal keratins and that appears to play some role in DPI tail binding.

While a number of cell types stabilize homophilic cadherin-mex~ated associations by connecting to an actin cytoskeletal network (Pasdar et al., 1991; Pasdar and Nelson, 1988), others, including heart muscle and epidermis, orchestrate cell adhesion through desmosomes, which connect to intermediate filament (IF) ~ networks (Garrod, 1993). Desmosomes are symmetrical membranous plaques that are several microns in diameter and ~100 um thick. Each half of the desmosome is derived from an adjacent cell, and IFs from both cells appear to loop through the cytoplasmic peripheries of the structure (Kell); 1966). Desmosomes contaln two subtypes of the transmembrane glycoprotein super M  Address  all correspondence to Elaine Fuchs, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, The University of Chicago, 5841 S.

Typical of cadherin-mediated junctions, desmosomes also contain a member of the catenin family, plakoglobin (Cowin et al., 1986; Gumbiner and McCrea, 1993). Unique to desmosomes and not seen in actin-mediated adherens junctions are two proteins, desmoplakin I and II (DPI and DPII), which seem to be splice variants encoded by a single gene that is widely expressed in cells that possess desmosomes (Green et al., 1988; Angst et al,, 1990). In contrast to the desmosomal cadherins, desmoplakin has no obvious transmembrane domain, and it appears to be a cytoplasmic protein (Green et al., 1990, 1992). Antibody studies indicate that desmoplakin resides in the inner plaque zone, between the plaque and the intermediate filaments (Miller et al., 1987; Jones and Grelling, 1989). Based on its location and on the absence of an obvious homologue in actin-mediated, cell-cell adherens junctions, desmoplakin has emerged as a leading candidate for making the molecular connections between desmosomes and IFs. As visualized by electron microscopy of rotary shadowed images, purified DPI is a dimer that has a rodlike structure with folded or globular amino (head) and carboxy (tail) domains (O'Keefe et al., 1989). Although it was initially suggested that the rod domain of ·130 nm might represent a tail-to-tail  © The Rockefeller University Press, 0021-9525/94/I 1/1049/12 $2,00 The JournalofCelI Biology, Volume 127, Number4, November 1994 1049-1060  1049  Published November 1, 1994  association of DPI monomers (O'Keefe et al., 1989), secondary structure analysis of the DPI sequence predicts a coiledcoil rod of this size, with a smaller rod predicted for the DPII splice product (Green et al., 1990). DPFs head (&amp;gt;862 aa) and tail (851 aa) are identical in size and sequence to those of DPII (Green et al., 1990; Virata et al., 1992). Truncated DPI molecules have been transiently expressed at very high levels in COS simple epithelial cells, which have few desmosomes, and in mouse fibroblasts, which have none (Stappenbeck and Green, 1992; Stappenbeck et al., 1993). In the absence of the NH2-terminal head domain, DPI molecules were unable to associate with desmosomal plaques, and instead they colocalized with the endogenous IF network (Stappenbeck and Green, 1992; Stappenbeck et al., 1993). In both fibroblasts and in simple epithelial cells, this association was maintained as long as the COOH-terminal tail domain of DPI was present. However, when treated with a nonionic detergent, fibroblasts released the DPI rod-tail domain into the soluble fraction, whereas simple epithelial cells retained it with the cytoskeleton (Stappenbeck et al., 1993). From these data, it might be predicted that DPI associates more strongly with a simple epithelial keratin network than with a vimentin IF network. Little is known about the precise nature of the association between the 851 amino acid residue DPI tail and IFs. While removal of 68 residues from the COOH-terminal end of the DPI tail obliterates the interaction, at least in simple epithelial cells, the 68-residue COOH terminus on its own is not sufficient for the association (Stappenbeck and Green, 1993). Even less is known about the IF sequences involved in this interaction, and efforts to identify a direct association between purified DPI and tongue epithelial keratins have been unsuccessful (O'Keefe et al., 1989). A priori, the failure to cosediment keratin IFs and purified DPI might seem to support the notion that the interaction might be indirect, rather than direct. However, these data do not resolve the issue, since (a) the extensive purification procedure that was used for desmoplakins required potentially denaturing buffers; (b) the NH2-terminal domain of desmoplakin, when removed from its interactions with other desmosomal components, could adopt a new conformation which in turn prevents the association between the COOH-terminal domain of desmoplakin and IFs; and (c) the status of the COOH termitins of purified DPI, critical for IF association, was not determined. In this report, we use epidermal keratinocytes, where desmosomes are abundant, to delve more deeply into the precise nature of this interaction. We present experiments that suggest that the interaction between DPI and epidermal keratins is a direct one involving the NH2-terminal head domain of type II epidermal keratins and the COOH-terminal tail domain of DPI. We show that the association between the DPI tail and IFs is more prominent for epidermal keratin iliamerits than for simple epithelial keratin filaments or vimentin IFs. Finally, we have identified a segment of the head that is conserved among type II epidermal keratins and that seems to be involved in the binding to DPI. Our findings have important implications for understanding why a point mutation in the head of a type II epidermal keratin may lead to keratin network instability and epidermal cell fragility in a family with palmoplantar keratoderma (Kimonis, V., J. J. DiGiovanna, J.-M. Yang, S. Z. Doyle, S. J. Bale, and J. G. Compton. J. Invest. Dermatol. 102:545a).  Materials and Methods  Plasmid Constructs phDPIrt. A 7-kb DPI/II genomic clone was isolated from a human genomic library in lambda Charon 4A, and it was cloned into the EcoRI site of plasmid Bluescript KS+. This clone encodes the entire rod and all but 18 codons of the tail of DPI. A 2.5-kb cDNA clone containing 2 kb of 3' coding sequence and 0.5 kb of 3' nontranslated sequence of DPI was isolated from a human keratinocyte eDNA library in lambda gO 1 (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The two clones were combined using a unique BstEII site in the coding sequence, so that a complete rod and tail sequence was generated. This sequence was cloned into the EcoRI site of pKS+ to generate phDPIrt. The sequences of these clones were identical to that of the previously published DPI (Green et al., 1990). pFG.DPtail. A 3.2-kb Ndel-Klenow/Spel fragment containing sequences extending from the proline codon 1863 to 0.3 kb 3' of the TGA stop codon was subeloned in frame at the BglII-Klenow/XbaI site of the plasmid pECE-FLAG, a mammalian expression vector containing the SV-40 major early promoter and enhancer, followed by an ATG and sequences encoding the 9-amino acid residue FLAG epitope tag, followed by a polyLinker region, followed by a 3' untranslated and polyadenylation site from SV-40 (kindly provided by Dr. Magnus Pfahl, La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA). pET8c.DPtail. An NcoI site was created by PCR mutagenesis 5' of the lysine codon 1987, and a fragment encoding the DP taft plus 0.5 kb of 3' noncoding sequence was inserted at the NcoI/BamHI site of the pETSc bacterial vector (Studier and Moffatt, 1986). pET22b.KJH and Mutants. Plasmid pETK5 (Coulombe and Fuchs, 1990) was digested with BgLII to excise a 1.2-kb fragment containing sequences encoding the 164 amino acid residue K5 head domain plus four residues of helix 1A (for sequence, see Lersch et al., 1989). This fragment was then digested with Thai, digested with XbaI, and finally ligated into the bacterial vector pET22b (Novngen, Inc., Madison, WI) at its XbaI/NotI sites (Nod site was blunted with Klenow). The resulting vector contained a T7 promoter, followed by the K5 head (the leader and signal peptidase sequence of pET22b were removed), followed by a six-codon histidine tag sequence, TGA stop codon, and T7 termination sequence.  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Transfections and Immunofluorescence SCC-13 human epidermal keratinocytes (K14+, KS+) were transiently transfected and subjected to double immunofluorescence as described previously (Albers and Fuchs, 1987). The antibodies used were a 1:100 dilution of guinea pig anti-human K5 (Lersch et al., 1989), 10 #g/ml of a mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody 0BI-Kodak, New Haven, CT), and a 1:20 dilution of affinity-purified rabbit anti-human DPI tail antiserum. The polyclonal anti-DPI tail antiserum was prepared by injecting rabbits with an initial 200-#g purified recombinant DPI tail, followed by two 200-#g boosts separated at 3-wk intervals.  Overlay Binding Assays Protein levels were determined using the Bradford assay (1976). Purified DPI tail was biotinylated using the succinimide ester of biotin as described by Harlow and Lane (1988). The coupling occurs primarily through the free c-amino groups of lysine residues. Briefly, 1 mg of DPI taft in 1 ml PBS was subjected to centrifugetion at 25,000 g for 30 rain, and the supernatant (,,o0.7 mg/ml) was combined with a solution of 1 mg/ml N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin in diraethyl sulfoxide such that the molar ratio of biotin/DPI tail was 1.5. After 4 h at room temperature, 2/d of I M NIGCI was added, and the solution was incubated for another 10 rain before extensive dialysis against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, to remove uncoupled biotin. Ligand blotting assays were performed essentially as described by Merdes et al. (1991). l-ram thick SDS-polyacrylamide gels were made using ultrapure electropboresis reagents (Bio Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). After electropboresis of duplicate gels, one gel was used for staining with Coomassie blue to visualize the proteins, and the other was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (35 V for 2 h at room temperature) in a buffer containing 57.6 g glycine, 12.1 g Tris (base), 4 g SDS, and 800 ml methanol per 4 liters of solution. Blots were washed three times with buffer (0.9% [wt/vol] NaCI, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mM MgCI2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% [wt/vol] gelatin [Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO], and 0.2 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride) at room temperature. The blots were then probed with buffer containing 0.2/tg/ml biotinylated DPI tail at room temperature for 1-2 h. After extensive washing, blots were  The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 127, 1994  1050  Published November 1, 1994  incubated at 4°C for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin (Boeringher-Mannheim Bioehemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Blots were washed 4 x 15 min and were then developed by the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL).  Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) Purification of Keratins, Filament Assembly, and Quantiation. Bacterially expressed keratins were isolated from inclusion bodies and purified by a Mono-Q anion exchange column (Coulombe and Fuchs, 1990). Keratins were concentrated by filtration through Centricon-10 units (Amicon, W. R. Grace &amp; Co., Beverly, MA). K5 and K14 or corersponding mutants were mixed in a 1:1.05 ratio (K5:K14) and were purified as a heteromeric complex by FPLC. All buffers contained 10 mM B-mereaptoethanol and were at pH 7.5. Complexes were equilibrated by dialysis against the following buffers: (a) 9.5 M urea, 10 mM Tris.HC1 (10 h at room temperature); (b) 4 M urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl (12 h, at room temperature); and (c) 1 M urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl (2 h at 4°C), (d) 5 mM Tris-HCl buffer (2 h at 4°C), twice.  Results The DPI Tail Associates with Epidermal Keratin Networks In Vivo Our first goal was to assess whether the DPI tail associates in vivo with epidermal keratin networks, as it appears to do with vimentin and simple epithelial keratin networks. We began our studies by adding an NH2-terminal epitope "FLAG" tag fused in frame to 927 COOH-terminal amino acid residues of human DPI that we had isolated from a human keratinocyte kgtl 1 cDNA library (Fig. 1 A). The sequence included the short linker region spanning the c~-helical rod domain and the tail, and in its entirety, was identical to that previously reported by Green et al. (1990). When expressed transiently in cultured epidermal keratinocytes or in COS simple epithelial cells, this expression vector, referred to as pFG.DPtail, produced a single species that could be detected at low levels in immunoblots incubated with a rabbit anti-DPI tail polyclonal antiserum and at high levels by an  anti-FLAG antiserum (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to endogenous DPI and DPII (open arrowheads), '~80% of the DPI tail (solid arrowhead) in epidermal keratinocytes and nearly 100% of the DPI tall in COS cells were solubilized upon sonication in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Additionally, the level of expression of the DPI tail in transfected COS cells was estimated to be &amp;gt;100x its level in keratinocytes, as judged by the failure of anti-FLAG to detect the transgene product in keratinocyte extracts. When transiently transfected into SCC-13 keratinocytes, pFG.DPtail decorated the epidermal kerat~, network (Fig. 2, A and C, anti-FG; B and D, anti-K5). Approximately 5 % of cells were transfected. About 5-10% of these transfected epidermal keratinocytes displayed a collapsed or partially collapsed keratin filament network (Fig. 2, A-D). Often, the keratin network appeared unaffected, and in no case did the FG.DPtail colocalize with desmosomes (Fig. 2 E, anti-FG; and F, anti-DP). The lack of colocalization between the DPI tail and desmosomes was in agreement with Stappenbeck and Green (1992), who showed that the NH2 terminus of DPI is required for its association with desmosomes in simple epithelial (COS) cells. Overall, however, the behavior of the DPI tail in keratinocytes was distinct from that seen in COS simple epithelial cells, where virtually all the transfected cells displayed a collapse of the keratin network (Stappenbeck and Green, 1992; Kouklis and Fuchs, data not shown). Presumably, the combination of closer to physiological levels of transgene expression, a more stable keratin network, and a larger number of anchoring desmosomes made the epidermal keratin IF network more resistant to collapse than the simple epithelial one. It is possible that the association observed in vivo between the desmoplakin tail and the keratin IF network was disrupted by the cytoskeletal extraction procedure used in our  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Figure 1.

Human epidermal keratinocytes (SCC-13) were transiently transfected with pFG.DPtail, and 65 h later, cells were fixed and processed for double immunofluorescence using a mouse monoclonal anti-FG antibody and either a guinea pig polyclonal antisera against human K5 COOH-terminal peptide or an afffinity-purifiedrabbit polyclonal antisera against human DPI tail.

This may have resulted artificially in high levels of DPI proteins that were not tightly associated with the keratin cytoskeleton. epithelial cells (Stappenbeck and Gren, 1992) and in epidermal cells (this study), colocalization does not distinguish between a direct or indirect association. To explore the possibility that the DPI tail might directly interact with keratin IFs, we focused our attention towards in vitro assays, which necessitated a purification scheme for the DPI tail. To this end, we first subcloned sequences encoding 847 COOHterminal amino acids, beginning at domain A of the DPI tall, into the bacterial expression plasmid pET-SC, which has a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence located just 5' from a multiple cloning region (Studier and Motfatt, 1986; Rosenberg et al., 1987).

Purification of human DPI tail. Log phase (OD60o = 0.6) cultures of pETSc.DPtall bacteria were induced with 1 mM IFIG, and cells were harvested 3-4 h later. IBFs were prepared as described by Kouklis et al. (1993), and the final pellet was solubilized in urea buffer 1 consisting of 6 M urea, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8. After centrifugation at 25,000 g to remove insoluble material, the protein was then subjected to chromatography on a hydroxyapatite (HAP) column equilibrated with urea buffer 1. After extensive washing with urea buffer 1, protein was eluted in 6 M urea, 200 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8. The eluent, containing &amp;gt;80% of the total DP tail protein, was then dialyzed against urea buffer 2, consisting of 6 M urea, 50 mM Bicine, pH 8.7, and then loaded onto a Mono S cation exchange column equilibrated in this buffer. The protein was eluted by a 0-500-mM NaC1 gradient in urea buffer 2. Aliquots (2-/zl) of each of the 500-/~1 fractions eluted from the gradient were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Samples from HAP chromatography were: lane 1, crude IBF preparation; lane 2, flow through of the column; lane 3, wash fraction; lane 4, fraction just after the switch to elution buffer; lane 5, eluted protein. Samples from Mono S chromatography were: lane 1, HAP-eluted protein after dialysis; lane 2, flow through of the column; lanes 3-10, alternate fractions from the salt gradient, beginning with fraction 9 and ending with fraction 23. Molecular mass standards are shown at left in kilodaltons.

When solubilized and resolved by SDS-PAGE, inclusion body fractions flBFs) included a prominent band not present in total bacterial cell extracts (Fig. 3, lane 1, upper band). This band displayed an electrophoretic mobility corresponding to 96 kD, which was in good agreement with the 97-kD mass predicted from the amino acid sequence of the DPI tail. Subsequent immunoblot analysis using an anti-DPI tail monospecific antiserum confirmed the identity of this band (data not shown). Approximately 25-30% of the total IBF consisted of DPI tail or proteolytic fragments thereof. Intact DPI tail from pETSc.DPtail-transformed cells was purified in two steps, using hydroxy apatite (HAP) column chromatography and Mono S cation exchange (FPLC) chromatography. The DPI tail aggregated under low ionic strength conditions, but it was soluble at 250 #g/ml in phosphate buffered saline, and unless otherwise indicated, the DPI tail was maintained in this buffer. Fig. 3 shows the purity of the DPI tail after (a) hydroxyapatite chromatography; and (b) cation exchange chromatography. As judged by densitometry scanning of the Coomassie blue-stained gels, the DPI tail was &amp;gt;95 % pure after these two columns. As judged by Coomassie blue staining of an overloaded SDS-PAGE gel and subsequent identification by immunoblot analysis (not shown), a slight degradation product of the DPI tail fragment was the only other band detectable in the purified fraction. marily in the supernatant (S) and not in the pellet (P) when subjected to centrifugation at 27,000 g for 2 h at 4°C (Fig. 4). In the presence of a control protein, such as bovine serum albumin, the DPI tail also remained soluble. In contrast, when the DPI tail was added in near stoichiometric amounts to an IF assembly mixture containing the recombinant human epidermal keratins K5 and K14, the assembled keratin IFs, as well as the DPI tail, were quantitatively pelleted  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Figure4. Purified DPI tail cosediments with epidermal keratin illaments. Epidermal keratin filaments were reconstituted in vitro using recombinant human K5 (58 kD) and K14 (50 kD) at 200 #g/ml (see Materials and Methods). The assembly was conducted in the presence or absence of 100 #g/ml DPI tail (97 kD). As controis, assembly reactions were also conducted (a) in the presence of DPI tail and the absence of K5 and K14, and (b) in the presence of DPI tail and BSA (67 kD). After assembly, the polymerized ilia* ments were sedimented by centrifugation at 27,000 g for 2 h. Soluble (S) and pellet (P) fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis through 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels. Molecular mass standards are indicated at left. Note: During extended polymerization times at room temperature, the DPI tail had a tendency to break down somewhat, but this did not seem to interfere with its ability to associate with K5 and K14.  A Direct Interaction between the DPI Tail and 1))pc H Epidermal Keratins When taken together with our immunofluorescence studies, our immunoblot experiments suggested that although the DPI tail associates with the epidermal keratin filament network, this association is not sufficient to withstand sonication in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. To further explore the nature of this interaction, and to assess whether it is a direct or an indirect one, we first determined whether the purified DPI tail was able to associate with assembled keratin filaments in vitro. On its own, the DPI tail remained pri Kouldis  et al. Direct Interactions between Desmoplakin and Keratin  1053  Published November 1, 1994  when subjected to centrifugation (Fig. 4). These findings suggested that in vitro, in the absence of other auxiliary proteins or factors, the DPI tall associated with epidermal keratin filaments when present in physiological buffers. To further explore the possibility that the DPI tail might directly interact with epidermal keratins, we performed a blot overlay assay (Merdes et al., 1991) using biotinylated DPI tail to probe nitrocellulose blots containing either SDSPAGE-resolved recombinant IF proteins (Fig. 5 A) or IF proteins isolated from various cell types and tissues (Fig. 5  B). For both studies, the SDS-PAGE gels are shown at the left and the nitrocellulose blots are shown at the right after probing with biotinylated DPI tail, followed by washing and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin to visualize the binding. The IF proteins analyzed for DPI tail binding included: Fig. 5 A, a mixture of recombinant human K5 and K14 (Coulombe and Fuchs, 1990), recombinant human K6a (gift of P. A. Coulombe, Johns Hopkins University Medical School, Baltimore, MD), and recombinant human vimentin  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Figure 5. Direct association of the DPI tail with type II epidermal keratins. (A) Recombinant human IF proteins, including K5 and K14 (heterodimers isolated by Mono Q fplc), as well as K6 and vimentin, were subjected to electrophoresis through 8.5 % SDS polyacrylamide gels and either stained with Coomassie blue (le~) or transferred to nitrocellulose paper by electroblotting. Blots were then incubated with either DPI tall, BSA, vimentin, or DPI rod segment, each biotinylated as described in the Methods. After binding, blots were washed and processed as described in the Methods. The loading order for blots is the same as that for stained gel, except for the DPI rod segment, where only the K5/K14 complex was tested. Note: K5 (58 kD) and K14 (50 kD) were combined before loading. Note: The faint binding of DPI tail to vimentin is bona fide; the faint hybridizing band in the K5-K14 lane represents a breakdown product of K5, and is not K14. (B) IF proteins were extracted from human epithelial cells and tissues as described (Wu et al., 1982), except for SCC-13 IFs, which were extracted in 1% Triton X100 in PBS. For skin samples, epidermis was separated from dermis with 2 M NaBr at 37°C for 15 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed as outlined in (A). Shown are the Coomassie blue-stained gel and the DPI tail overlay assay for human IF proteins of SCC-13 epidermal keratinocytes, backskin epidermis, foreskin epidermis, and MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells. Keratins are as indicated, according to the nomenclature of Moll et al. (1982). (C) Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble extracts from SCC-13 keratinocytes were overloaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE as above. After transferring to nitrocellulose, one blot was stained with India ink. Identical blots were subjected to overlay assays using either biotinylated BSA as a control, or biotinylated DPI tail. Note: Two major bands, primarily in the soluble fraction but also faint in the insoluble fraction, were artifacts of the streptavidin secondary reagent, and were detected irrespective of the source of the biotinylated protein.  The Journal of Cell Biology,Volume 127, 1994  1054  Published November 1, 1994  (McCormick et al., 1993); and Fig. 5 B, SCC-13 epidermal keratins (K5, K6a/K6b, K14, K15, K16, K17, and K19; Wu and Rheinwald, 1981), backskin epidermal keratins (K1, K2, K5, and K14; Fuchs and Green, 1980; Collin et al., 1992), foreskin epidermal keratins (K1, K5, and K14; Fuchs and Green, 1980; Collin et al., 1992), and MCF-7 keratins (K8, K10, K18, and K19; Moll et al., 1982). Biotinylated DPI tail bound to recombinant K5 and K6a, but not to vimentin (Fig. 5 A, middle blot). The smaller, faintly interacting band in the K5 and K14 mixture (arrowhead) did not have the same mobility as K14, and was a degradation product of K5, a feature confirmed by running the two recombinant proteins independently (examples are given below). Binding to K5 and K6a was not detected when biotinylated BSA, vimentin, or the DPI rod domain were used as controls (blots at right). Of these, only vimentin showed binding, and as expected, this was to itself. Biotinylated DPI tail also bound to all type II epidermal keratins, including K1 (67 kD) and K2 (65 kD), as well as K6 (56 kD) and K5 (58 kD) (Fig. 5 B). While levels of different type II epidermal keratins varied among samples, making quantitation difficult, binding was roughly comparable to all four keratins. No binding was detected for smaller, i.e., type I epidermal keratins, including K14 (50 kD), K15 (50 kD), K16 (48 kD), K17 (46 kD), and K19 (40 kD). Since K5 comigrated with K10 in the skin extracts, we cannot unequivocally rule out weak binding to K10. Interestingly, no appreciable binding was detected between the DPI tall and K8 (53 kD), K18 (44 kD), or K19 (40 kD) from human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. This was also the case for human LP-9 mesothelial cells (not shown), which express the type II keratin, K7 (55 kD), in addition to the other keratins produced by MCF-7 cells (Wu et al., 1982; Kim et al., 1987). When taken together, our results from sedimentation and overlay assays demonstrated convincingly that the DPI tail and IF proteins can interact directly. Additionally, this reaction appeared to be strongest with the type II epidermal keratins. To more rigorously test the specificity of the biotinylated DPI tail, we repeated the overlay assays, this time using gels containing overloaded levels of crude Triton X-100-insoluble and -soluble keratinocyte extracts (Fig. 5 C). The two major hybridizing bands in the soluble extract were detected by the streptavidin secondary reagent, and were not specific for the DPI tail. Overall, these data convincingly demon strated  that the interaction between the DPI tail and the type II keratins is specific.  Without the Head Domain of a ~ p e H Epidermal Keratin, the DPI Tail Cannot Associate with It To identify the portion of the type II epidermal keratins involved in direct binding to the DPI tail, we tested binding of the biotinylated tail to a battery of previously engineered truncation mutants of the human K5 polypeptide (for details of K5 mutants, see Wilson et al., 1992). Fig. 6 illustrates the results of this experiment, and its shows the Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel (A) and the blot overlay assay (B). In contrast to full-length K5 that bound the DPI tail strongly (Fig. 6 B, lane/), K5NA71, missing 71 amino acids of the amino terminal head domain, bound the DPI tail only weakly (Fig. 6 B, lane 2). K5NA157, missing the entire head domain, exhibited no appreciable binding of the DP tail (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). Similarly, headless and tailless K5, missing both head and tail domains, showed no appreciable interaction with the DPI tail in this ligand-blot assay (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). However, two tailless mutants, K5CAll7 and K5CAlll, missing the 111-residue COOH-terminal tall of K5, displayed DPI tail binding that was indistinguishable from wild-type (Fig. 6 B, lanes 5 and 6, respectively; compare with wildtype in lane/). Collectively, these data suggested that without the head domain, the ability of the type II epidermal keratins to interact specifically with the DPI tail is lost.  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Expression and Purification of the K5 Head Domain and Demonstration that the Head Contains SuJficient Information to Confer Binding to the DPI Tail A priori, the loss of DPI tail binding as a consequence of removing the keratin head domain does not necessarily imply that the K5 head domain contains sequences sufficient for DPI tail binding. To test this possibility, purification of the K5 head domain was necessary. In this case, sequences spanning the ATG translation start codon (i.e., codon 1) to codon 168 of the human K5 protein (Lersch et al., 1989) were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET22b, containing six histidine codons and a TGA stop codon in frame and just 3' to the K5 sequences. This enabled a one step nickel column purification of the K5 head starting from solubilized IBF proteins (Fig. 7). The electrophoretic mobility of the purified K5 head protein was 20 kD, in good agreement with  Figure 6. Removal of the head domain abolishes the binding of K5 to the DPI tail. Head and tail mutants of recombinant human K5 (Wilson et al., 1992) were resolved by SDS-PAGEand subjected to the filter-immunobilized, ligand-binding assay with biotinylated DPI tail.

The K5 head associates with the DPI tail directly, on Figure 7. Purification of the human K5 head domain. A Novagen kit was used to purify the K5 head from overnight, IPTG-induced cultures of pET26.K5H bacteria. Note: the leader sequence in the construct was deleted, so the protein remains in the cytoplasm. Briefly, inclusion bodies were purified and solubilized in the recommended buffer that contained 6 M urea.

(,4) Purified K5 head (test; 0.7 #g/sample) and K5NA157 (1,2 ~g/sample) were transferred to nitrocellulose paper using a dot blot apparatus. Binding reactions with the biotinylated DPI tail (0.25 #g/ml) were then carried out in the absence or presence of unlabeled K5 head at the following concentrations: 0, 0.1, 0.4, and 0.8/~g/ml (left to right). After binding reactions, blots were washed and processed as described in Materials and Methods. Note: When very high levels of unlabeled K5 head were added to the binding assay, the DPI tail seemed to show some weak binding to K5NA 157, perhaps as a consequence of an indirect interaction involving the K5 head. (B) Recombinant human K14 was combined with either K5 or K5NA71, purified as a complex (200 t~g/ml), and assembled into filaments as described in the Methods. After assembly, IFs were spotted onto nitrocellulose paper and were subjected to an overlay assay with biotinylated DPI tail. Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  that predicted by amino acid sequence. As judged by densitometry scanning, the K5 head was &amp;gt;98 % pure. To test whether the purified K5 head interacted with the DPI tall, we spotted equimolar amounts of headless K5 (NA157) and the K5 head (K5H) on nitrocellulose paper and subjected the dot blot to an overlay binding assay with biotinylated DPI tail. As shown in Fig. 8 A, the DPI tall bound to the K5 head under conditions where no association with the headless K5 occurred. The level of DPI binding to the purified K5 head was comparable to that which we had previously observed with filter-immobilized wild-type K5. The results were not appreciably different when the ionic strength of the binding buffer was increased to 1.5 M, suggesting that the association does not depend on electrostatic interactions (data not shown). Moreover, binding of the DPI tall to the K5 head was still appreciable when 3 M urea was added to the binding buffer (not shown). Finally, the association also took place in solution, as judged by the ability of competitor K5H in solutin to block the binding of the DPI tall to nitrocellulose-immobilized K5H (Fig. 8 A). Collectively, these studies provided direct evidence that it is the head domain of the epidermal type II keratins that contains the information necessary for interaction with the DPI tail. If the head domain of K5 is physiologically important in binding to the DPI tail, then it must be accessible when in  the context of filaments. While our cosedimentation data in Fig. 4 suggest that this is the case, we tested this possibility directly by overlay assays. Wild-type K14 was combined with either (a) wild-type K5 or (b) K5NA71, and it was subjected to filament assembly under conditions where both mixtures assemble efficiently into IFs (Wilson et al., 1992). These IFs were then spotted directly on nitrocellulose, and were subjected to the overlay assay with biotinylated DPI tail. As shown in Fig. 8 B, filaments assembled from wild-type K5 and K14 showed marked binding to the DPI tail. In contrast, no appreciable binding was seen with filaments assembled from K5NA71 and K14, consistent with our results in Fig. 6, showing that most of the binding was lost when 71 amino acids were removed from the amino end of K5. Collectively, these data provide additional evidence that the K5 head is accessible in the 10-nm filament, and that in this context, it is the domain interacting with the DPI tail.  The Central Portion of the K5 Head is Important for the DPI Tail Binding Activity Fig. 9 illustrates the sequence of the human K5 head domain. To further define the portion of the type II epidermal head domain involved in the interaction with the DPI tall, we first  The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 127, 1994  1056  Published November 1, 1994  Head  Helix 1A _ _  I NTCB  I ENDO LYS-C  I NTCB  I I 164  I 53  I 71  I 133  K5VVT 53- ~ V K1 K2 K5 1(6 K8  .~  GGYG S R  R I S I S -76  IGGFGSRS ~G[LGGrKS~S~S I LGGYG S R S LYINILG GS KRISlSl AIGF G s . s L~IGI'G GS K . , S , ~ .

The digest was only a partial one, cleaving "~60% NH2-terminal to cysteine 54, with little or no cleavage NH2-terminal to cysteine 134 (Fig. 10 A, Coomassie blue-stained gel, compare lane 1, intact, with lane 2, NTCB digestion). However, it was very clear from the overlay binding assay in Fig. 10 B that the ,~13 kD, ll0-amino acid NTCB peptide (residues 54-164 of the K5 head) still bound to the biotinylated DPI tail in a fashion indistinguishable from the intact head (lanes I and 2, respectively).  To further define the K5 head sequences important for DPI tail-binding activity, we used endolysine protease (ENDO LYS-C), which cleaves COOH-terminal to lysine residues, to generate 93 and 71 amino acid polypeptides (Fig. 10 A, lane 3; ~11 and 9 kD, respectively). Since electrophoretic transfer of these smaller sized peptides to nitrocellulose was not efficient, we separated the two ENDO LYS-C bands by nickel column chromatography. Bound and flow-through fractions were then spotted on nitrocellulose paper and hybridized with the biotinylated DPI tail (Fig. 10 C). Both peptides exhibited some binding with the DPI tail, although of the two, the 71-residue peptide corresponding to the amino terminal half of the K5 head (flow-through) displayed markedly stronger ( &amp;gt; 6 x ) binding than the 93 residue peptide (bound). This result is consistent with our previous finding that K5NA71 bound the DPI tall only weakly (see Fig. 6). When taken together with the NTCB data, these results suggest that residues 54-71 of the K5 head contain information critical for efficient DPI association. This said, there may be additional sequences within the head that also play a role in binding.  Discussion A Direct Association between IFs and DPI We have extended earlier in vivo studies by Stappenbeck and Green (1992) and Stappenbeck et al. (1993) to show that the DPI tail interacts with keratin networks of desmosome-rich epidermal keratinocytes. In addition, our in vitro studies, first with sedimentation assays and then with overlay binding assays, provide the first data that directly link the DPI tail with an IF network. These findings are in contrast to those of O'Keefe et al. (1989), who did not observe cosedimentation between keratin filaments and DPI that had been isolated  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Figure 10. Sequences extending from an NTCB site to an endolysine C site in the K5 head domain are important for DPI tail binding. Recombinant K5 head protein (lane 1) was subjected to (a) chemical cleavage using the cysteine-specific reagent NTCB (lane 2) or (b) enzymatic cleavage using endolysine C protease (lane 3). For NTCB digestions, 30/~g of K5 head in 40 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, was subjected to digestion with 2 mM NTCB. After 40 min at room temperature, the pH was adjusted to 9.0 with Tris base, and the digestion was allowed to proceed for an additional 6 h at 37°C. For endolysine C digestion, 125/~g K5 head in 500 #12M urea buffer was digested with 0.3 U endolysine C protease for 2 h at 37°C. After digestion, the head fragments were resolved by electrophoresis through 15% SDS polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie blue to visualize the fragments (A). Note that the NTCB digest was a partial, generating a ll0-residue carboxy terminal fragment (solid arrowhead) and a 53-residue amino terminal fragment (diffuse band in lane 2 of PAGE). The 133-residue NTCB site did not appear to be cleaved appreciably in this assay. Endolysine C protease cleavage was quantitative, generating a 93- (solid diamond) and a 71- (open diamond) residue fragment. The K5 head and the NTCB fragments of the 1(.5 head were subjected to an overlay assay using biotinylated DPI tail (B). The full-length head and the ll0-residue carboxy portion of the head showed binding. The endolysine C protease fragments were subjected to nickel ion allinity chromatography to separate the bound 93-residue histidine tagged fragment from the flowthrough 71 residue fragment. After separation, the fragments were transferred to nitrocellulose in triplicate using a dot blot apparatus (C), and were tested for either protein level with India ink or DPI tail binding with biotinylated probe (shown in duplicate). K5, K14, and K5NA 157 were used as controls. Note that the flow-through 71-residue fragment contained the majority of the binding activity. Molecular mass standards are in kilodaltons at left. Kouldis et al. Direct Interactions between Desmoplakin and Keratin 1057  Published November 1, 1994  and purified from bovine tongue. It is possible that the purification of intact DPI from the desmosomal plaque causes a change in DPI conformation, which in turn affects the tail in a manner that masks or alters its IF binding capacity. Such a change could be physiologically important at times when desmosomes internalize and DPI becomes soluble (see for example, Duden and Franke, 1988). It is also possible that the recombinant DPI tail that we used differs from the corresponding domain of the purified, endogenous DPI used by O'Keefe (1989). In this regard, either phosphorylation or loss of a small but critical portion of the DPI tail during purification might change its binding properties. Further studies will be necessary to fully understand the nature of these differences. While the DPI tail clearly associates with the keratin network in keratinocytes, it does not associate tightly in vivo, and can be removed by extraction and sonication in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. This said, we were able to recapitulate binding to reconstituted filaments in vitro and to purified K5 head in solution and on blots, thereby demonstrating that the association can be a direct one. We don't yet know whether DPI might be in a different phosphorylation state in vivo that gives rise to a less stable association, or whether accessory proteins might be needed to provide greater stability to this association when it is localized at the desmosomal plaque. In this regard, it is interesting that band 6, a desmosomal protein expressed suprabasally in the epidermis, can associate with the type I simple epithelial keratin K18 in vitro (Kapprell et al., 1988).  Some of the IF sequences that we have identified as being critical for efficient binding to the DPI tail are not present in vimentin, and they are divergent in the simple epithelial keratins as well. Our failure to detect appreciable binding of the DPI tail to vimentin may be relevant to the recent results of Stappenbeck et al. (1993), who observed that a mutant of the DPI tail that is missing the 68 COOH-terminal residues could still associate with vimentin in transfected fibroblasts, but not with keratins in simple epithelial cells. Thus, the sequences within the DPI tail that are required for coalignment with vimentin may differ from those that are required for association with epidermal keratins. This is perhaps not surprising, in light of the existence of tissue-specific isoforms of desmogleins and desmocollins, which in turn could influence the nature of the association between DPI and IFs, particularly if they are additional cell-type specific factors involved in stabilizing these interactions.  The Importance of the Type H Epidermal Keratin Sequences to Disease and to DPI-IF Superstructure The overlying binding data point to an 18-amino acid sequence in the head of K5 that seems to play a role in DPI tail binding. A survey of IF head sequences indicates that this sequence overlaps largely with a highly conserved stretch of 20 amino acids extending from residues 57 to 76 of the K5 head (Fig. 9). This segment contains a number of residues that are conserved among all type II epidermal keratins, but that are less conserved in K8, and not discernable in vimentin, K7, or in type I keratins. Within the motif, several sequences are worthy of discussion. The KRIS. Early in our studies, the lysine in this sequence became of particular interest to us because its biotinylation seemed to perturb the ability of the K5 head to associate with unlabeled DPI tail (not shown). Thus, we were especially intrigued when an abstract appeared reporting a mutation (K:I) at the equivalent lysine residue in K1 of a family with the human blistering skin disorder palmoplantar keratoderma (Kimonis et al., 1994). Of the more than 40 mutations thus far identified in genetic disorders of keratin, the K:I mutation in the K1 head is interesting in that it falls outside domains that have been implicated in IF assembly (Wilson et al., 1992). When mutated in the context of K5, K71:I causes a decrease, but does not ablate, the binding of the K5 head to the DPI tail (data not shown). Additionally, this lysine is a serine in K8, which does not associate with the DPI tail in our overlay assay. While other explanations are plausible, the K71:I mutation in K1 might weaken the association between desmosomes and epidermal keratin IFs, thereby contributing to fragility and hyperkeratosis in the suprabasal layers of the skin. If true, then some cases of this form of PPK may have mutations in the DPI gene, a hypothesis that can now be tested. The GSRS. We were also intrigued that the type II keratin motif for DPI binding contained the sequence GSRS because the DPI tail also contains a series of five GSRS repeats located 28 residues from its COOH terminus. A deletion that includes this region of the DPI tail ablates the association between the IF network and the DPI tail (Stappenbeck and Green, 1992; Stappenbeck et al., 1993). Among type II keratins, the GSRS sequence is strictly conserved in all type II epidermal keratins, but not in K8, a type II keratin that does not bind the DPI tail efficiently in our overlay assays. Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Epidermal Type H Keratins Preferentially Associate with the DPI Tail Intriguingly, our overlay assays revealed an association between the DPI tail and type II epidermal keratins under conditions where no such binding is seen with type I keratins of any source, with type II keratins from simple epithelial cells, or with vimentin. Given the studies of Stappenbeck and Green (1992) and Stappenbeck et al. (1993), we know that in vivo, the DPI tail can associate with simple epithelial keratin networks and with vimentin. How do we resolve this difference? Several points are worth considering. First, in contrast to some cell types where type 11I IFs associate with desmosomes (Kartenbeck et al., 1983, 1984; Tokuyasu et al., 1983a, 1983b), '~5-10% of SCC-13 epidermal keratinocytes express vimentin and form an independent vimentin IF network that does not associate with desmosomes (Kouldis, P., and E. Fuchs, unpublished observation). One possibility to account for the cell type-specific difference in vimentin IF-desmosome affinity is that tissue-specific phosphorylation states of DPI or tissue-specific proteins might influence the connection between DPI and type III IFs (or DPI and simple epithelial keratin IFs). This could result in a cellspecific variability affecting whether or not an IF network will associate with desmosomes. Alternatively, it could be that the affinity of demosplakin for epidermal keratins is simply much greater than it is for other IF proteins, and therefore, in the presence of an epidermal keratin network, other IFs cannot compete for the limited number of DPI proteins in the cell. While our studies do not distinguish between these possibilities, we certainly show that there is a dramatic difference in the relative abilities of IFs to associate with the DPI tail. The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 127, 1994  1058  Published November 1, 1994  We do not yet know whether the GSRS sequence motifs in the DPI tail are involved in the association with the GSRS motif in the K5 head domain. However, it is worth noting that arginine and serine sequence motifs have been implicated recently in protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions of the regulatory proteins that govern alternative splicing (Amrein et al., 1994). These protein-protein associations cannot be explained by generic interactions between RS domains, and in this regard, flanking residues appear to be critical (Amrein et al., 1994). Although the functional significance of the parallels between these two different sets of prorein-protein associations remains to be established, it could be that a specific array of protein-protein contacts mediated through sequence motifs in arginine- and serine-rich domains could control a variety of macromolecular assembly processes within higher eukaryotic cells.  References  Summary and Remaining Issues Our data provide a missing link in our understanding of the nature of associations between IFs and desmosomes. The increased stability of binding between the DPI tail and epidermal keratin head allowed us to observe direct binding in vitro, something that has not been possible for studies on other IF-desmoplakin interactions. While our data do not provide unequivocal evidence that the connection we observed in vitro is functional in vivo, the finding that features of palmoplantar keratoma can occur when this type II head motif is mutated lends support to the possible physiological importance of the interaction. A number of issues remain. Our preliminary mutagenesis studies have not uncovered a point mutation or small deletion in the K5 head that quantitatively obliterates binding to the DPI tail. Thus, the binding site may be determined by a larger number of residues, reminiscent of tertiary protein conformation. Similarly, if we interpret the findings of Stappenbeck and Green (1992) in light of our direct binding studies presented here, it is likely that the sequences within the 860-residue DPI tail that are involved in the association with IFs are also dependent on tertiary conformation. Indeed, computer studies indicate that both the type II epidermal head and the DPI tail are likely to be globular in structure (Conway and Parry, 1988; Green et al., 1992), a feature consistent with this notion. While crystallography will be necessary to provide a precise solution to the nature of the interaction, our ability to produce pure quantities of soluble DPI tail and K5 head now paves the way for this approach.

																				<Abstract>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor beta.(IL-2R beta) and common gamma (gamma c) chains. Mutations of gamma c can result in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain gamma c), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain gamma c) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3. Jak1 and Jak3 associated with IL-2R beta and gamma c, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R beta and increased Jak3-gamma c associations. Truncations of gamma c, and a gamma c, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased gamma c-Jak3 association. Thus, gamma c mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.</Abstract>

Schmalstieg, James N. Ihie, John J. O'Shea, Warren J. Leonard common  Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling requires the dimerization of the IL-2 receptor P (IL-2RP) and immunoy (-y) chains. Mutations of yc can result in X-linked severe combined deficiency (XSCID). IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (whose receptors are known to contain -y), and IL-9 (whose receptor is shown here to contain -y) induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases Jaki and Jak3. Jaki and Jak3 associated with IL-2RP and yc, respectively; IL-2 induced Jak3-IL-2R13 and increased Jak3-yc associations. Truncations of yc, and a yc, point mutation causing moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID), decreased yc-Jak3 association. Thus, y, mutations in at least some XSCID and XCID patients prevent normal Jak3 activation, suggesting that mutations of Jak3 may result in an XSCID-like phenotype.  (1994). 18. B. A.

The interaction of IL-2 with high-affinity  (1991).  High-affinity IL-2 receptors contain the IL-2 receptor ot (2), 13 (3), and -yc (4) chains. Intermediate-affinity receptors contain IL2RB and -yc and mediate IL-2 signals on natural killer (NK) and some resting T cells. Both IL-2RP and yc are members of the cytokine receptor superfamily (5), whereas IL-2Roa is not. The heterodimerization of P and -yc chains is induced by IL-2 binding and is required for IL-2 signaling (6). Mutations of the -yc gene can result in XSCID in humans (7); the severity of XSCID results from -yc being a component of multiple cytokine receptors ( 1, 8-1 1). Interleukin-2 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular substrates (12), including the Janus family kinases JakI and Jak3 (13, 14) (Fig. 1, A and B),  1042  SCIENCE  *  VOL. 266  *  11 NOVEMBER 1994  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on November 6, 2009  W.

HLA-DR7 alloantigen-specific T cell clones were generated according to standard methodology (11). Before each experiment, T cell clones were rested for 10 to 14 days in IL-2 without alloantigen restimulation. Before use, cells were cultured overnight in media. LBL-DR7 cells and NIH 3T3 transfectants were treated with mitomycin-C (8). T cell clones were cultured in a primary culture for 24 hours, separated from LBLDR7 cells by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and from NIH 3T3 transfectants by Percoll gradient centrifugation, and cultured in media without IL-2 for 12 hours. Each population was subsequently rechallenged with LBL-DR7 stimulators in secondary culture. 32. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 10 mM tris-HCI (pH 7.6), 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCI, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaFI, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, aprotinin (5 [ug/mI), pepstatin (1 p9g/ ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (2 gg/mI), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% NP-40, and 0.5% Brij 96 (Sigma). After immunoprecipitations, immune complexes were isolated on protein A-Sepharose, washed three times with lysis buffer, and analyzed on 6 to 12% gradient gels in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and membranes were blocked for 1  hour at room temperature by being shaken in trisbuffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST) [20 mM trisHCI (pH 7.6), 137 mM NaCI, and 0.1% Tween-201 containing 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA). For detection of phosphotyrosine proteins, the blots were incubated with antiphosphotyrosine (mAb 4G10 at 1:2000) for 60 min at room temperature. The blots were washed three times with wash buffer (TBST), then incubated for 60 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody to mouseIgG (at 1: 5000) (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). The blots were washed three times with wash buffer then incubated with the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham), exposed to x-ray film, and developed. 33. Stripping of the immunoblot was done by incubation in 62.5 mM tris-HCI (pH 6.8), 3% w/v SDS, and 100 mM P-mercaptoethanol at 500C for 1 hour. Subsequently, immunoblot was blocked for 1 hour at room temperature by being shaken in TBST containing 10% BSA, and it was reprobed with a different antibody. 34. We thank J.

Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Jak2 (anti-Jak2) yielded a tyrosine-phosphorylated band in response to IL-2 (Fig. ID); this band migrated faster than Jak2 and is human Jak3, immunoprecipitated through cross-reactivity with the Jak2 antiserum, as shown by its removal by preclearing with a Jak3-specific antiserum (Fig. iD). We also tested IL-4 and IL-7, two cytokines whose receptors contain yc, and IL-9 for their abilities to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jakl and Jak3. The IL-9 receptor also contains -y', because an antibody to y, inhibited IL-9-induced proliferation (15) and y, could be affinity-labeled by 1251-IL-9, yielding a band of appropriate size for IL-9 cross-linked to -yc (Fig. lE). Each of these cytokines induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B) and in vitro kinase activity (Fig. iF) of JakI and Jak3. Given the essential roles of IL-2R3 and ,yc in IL-2 signaling, we investigated their abilities to associate with Jakl and Jak3 (Fig. 2). We immunoprecipitated lysates of the NK-like YT cells with MikI 1 (antiIL-2RP) monoclonal antibody (mAb) or R878 (anti--yc) antiserum, immunoblotted with Jak3 and reblotted with JakI. Jakl constitutively associated with IL-2RP, and the association did not increase after IL-2 stimulation (Fig. 2). Jakl did not constitutively associate with yc, but after IL-2 stimulation and consequent IL-2RI-yc dimerization (16), some Jakl coprecipi tion  increased after IL-2 treatment (Fig. 2) (17). After IL-2 stimulation, Jak3 was coprecipitated with both anti-IL-2R13 mAbs MikI 1 (Fig. 2) and TU11 (15). This was expected for TU11, which coprecipitates ,yc in the presence of IL-2 (4, 18), but was unexpected for MikP1, which competes for IL-2 binding (19) and cannot coprecipitate yc. These data suggest that IL2R1 primarily associates with Jakl, and -yc with Jak3, but that IL-2R3-Jak3 interactions also occur. Although the basis for the IL-2-induced association of IL-2RP with Jak3 is unknown, IL-2-induced dimerization of IL-2RP and -yc may juxtapose Jak3 to IL-2R1, thereby facilitating their interaction. It is possible that distinct regions of Jak3 interact with IL-2RP and yc. To further evaluate the association of IL-2RP and -y, with JakI, we transiently  tated with y,. Jak3 weakly associated with wc in the absence of IL-2, and its associa We  evaluated the association of Jak3 with -yc mutants using antibodies to the extracellular (3B5) (20) (Fig. 4A) and intracellular (R878) (Fig. 4B) domains of ZY Jak3 efficiently interacted with y, but not with two truncated forms of Pyc (-ycACT and yj-ASH2, in which 80 and 48 Mikp1 200+  R878 RPC5 -++IL-2  * ,Jakl 97 'Jak3  69-  45-  St  S  ~4g-.ll SS;So  #;/istst~ ~ tf~g  Wu  A A.P  97 -Jak3  69-  (1  990).  45-04W_ 12345 B  &amp;  rO  0c  ;1  C  6.

The 48-amino acid truncation is smaller than the truncation (62 amino acids) in the XSCID patient with the smallest known naturally occurring -yc truncation (7). Thus, defective y,-Jak3 association is predicted to be found in many XSCID patients. Affected individuals in a family with a more moderate X-linked combined immunodeficiency (XCID) (21) have a single nucleotide change that results in replacement of Leu271 with Gln within the 'y, cytoplasmic domain (22). This mutation substantially diminished, but did not abrogate, yc association with Jak3 (Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with the disease phenotype in this pedigree being less severe than typical XSCID. Nevertheless, affected males have diminished development of  CD4' and CD8' T cells, decreased T cell responses to mitogens and IL-2, and a skewed T cell repertoire (21). Leu271 is not contained within the region deleted in the yJ-ASH2 mutant, suggesting that Jak3 may contact residues both proximal and distal to the yj-ASH2 deletion point. Because Jak3 was coprecipitated with MikPI from YT cells that had been stimulated with IL-2, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with IL-2RP and Jak3 and found that MikPi1 weakly but reproducibly coprecipitated Jak3, indicating that IL-2RP-Jak3 interactions can occur even in the absence of "yc (Fig. 4C). Our data show that Jakl and Jak3 have differential associations with IL-2R3 and YC. It has been reported that IL-2R1 and yc associate with Jakl and a 114-kD Jak2 kinase, respectively (23). No activation of Jakl was observed in MOLT4-0 leukemia cells (23), but JakI was activated in normal T cells (Fig. 1A). Because of its molecular size, the 114-kD Jak2 kinase was speculated to be a new member of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases, although no supportive data were presented (23). We now show that Jak3 but not Jak2 is activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-2. The reported activation of Jak2 was probably due to a cross-reactivity of the Jak2 antiserum with human Jak3 (Fig. 1D), because the same Jak2 antiserum can immunoblot both Jak2 and human Jak3 when transfected into COS-7 cells, whereas our antiserum to Jak3 will only react with Jak3 (15). The activation of Jak3 by all cytokine receptors that have yc as a component is logical, because Jak3 physically associates with -yc. However, the activation of Jakl by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-9 suggests that IL-4R, IL-7R, and IL-9R, like IL-2RP, all associate with Jakl. Because the IL-15 receptor, like the IL-2 receptor, contains IL-2R3 and yc (11), it seems likely that IL-15 will also activate Jaki and Jak3. The activation of JakI and Jak3 is presumably vital to the signals that are induced by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-9, but it is clear that the distinct signals induced by different cytokines whose receptors contain -yc cannot be explained solely by the involvement of JakI and Jak3. Distinctive actions, such as the induction by IL-4 of tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (24), may help to determine cytokine-specific actions and may reflect the abilities of specific receptor complexes to recruit different substrates for Jaks or other kinases. The differential association of Jakl and Jak3 with IL-2R1 and -y clarifies why heterodimerization of IL-2R3 and wy is required to transduce an IL-2 signal. The phenotype in XSCID emphasizes the crit ical  role of y,. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Jak3 activation is essential in the intrathymic maturation or selection of T cells and that XSCID can result from -yc mutations that interfere with cytokine binding to y, or the ability of yc to associate with Jak3. If so, mutations in Jak3 may be found in some autosomal recessive cases of immunodeficiency that are phenotypically similar to XSCID or XCID, and reagents that disrupt Jak3--yc association may be immunosuppressive.

Witthuhn, James N. Ihie, Tadatsugu Taniguchi The interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) consists of three subunits: the IL-2Rat, IL-2R1, and IL-2Ry chains, the last of which is also used in the receptors for IL-4, IL-7, and IL-9. Stimulation with IL-2 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus kinases Jaki and Jak3. Jaki and Jak3 were found to be selectively associated with the "serine-rich" region of IL-2R1 and the carboxyl-terminal region of IL-2Ry, respectively. Both regions were necessary for IL-2 signaling. Furthermore, Jak3-negative fibroblasts expressing reconstituted IL-2R became responsive to IL-2 after the additional expression of Jak3 complementary DNA. Thus, activation of Jaki and Jak3 may be a key event in IL-2 signaling.  IL-2 plays a pivotal role in immune responses by inducing the proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes (1). The IL-2RB and IL-2R-y subunits, but not the IL-2Roa subunit, are members of the cytokine receptor superfamily (2). A membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region of IL2R1, termed the "serine-rich" region (S region) (3), and the cytoplasmic domain of IL-2Ry are critical for IL-2 signaling (4, 5). Mutations of IL-2Ry are also associated with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) (6). Although lacking intrinsic kinase activity, IL-2R couples ligand binding to induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates, including IL-2RP and IL-2Ry (7). IL-2R is also linked to the serine-threonine kinase Raf-1 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and to the hydrolysis of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (1). IL-2Rj3 is T. Miyazaki, A. Kawahara, H. Fujii, Y. Nakagawa, Y. Minami, Z.-J. Liu, I. Oishi, T. Taniguchi, Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Suita-shi,  physically associated with Src-family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and Syk PTK (8, 9). Both IL-2 and IL-4 induce the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Janus kinases Jakl and Jak3 (10, 1 1), which suggests that these kinases might also associate with IL-2R and participate in IL-2 signaling. To determine if Jaks associate with the IL-2R subunits, we used CD4 chimeric receptors that could be detected with the same monoclonal antibody to human CD4 (anti-CD4) (Fig. 1A). Extracts of COS cells cotransfected with each chimeric receptor complementary DNA (cDNA) and one of the Jak cDNAs were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD4 and subjected either to immunoblot analysis with antisera to the respective Jaks (Fig. 1B) or to in vitro kinase assay (12). Expression levels of the respective Jaks and chimeric receptors did not vary among cotransfected COS cells (13). Both assays showed that Jakl could be coimmunoprecipitated with CD4P, but not with CD4-y or CD4yM1, whereas Jak3 could be coprecipitated with CD4y, but not with CD413 or CD4-yM1 (Fig. 1 B) ( 12). In contrast, the association of Jak2 with any of the CD4-IL-2R chiSCIENCE *  marginal (Fig. 1B) (12). Thus, the cytoplasmic domains of IL-2R13 and IL-2R~y possess regions capable of selectively associating with JakI and Jak3, and additional lymphoid-specific proteins are not required. Similar results were obtained in the IL-3-dependent cell line BAF-B03 that stably expresses each of the chimeric receptor cDNAs (14). We examined the association sites within the respective cytoplasmic domains of the IL-2R subunits with the respective Jaks, using cDNAs encoding CD4 chimeras that contained deletions in their cytoplasmic P or y domains (CD4PS, CD4PA, and CD4^yM2; Fig. lA). CD4^yM1 and CD4,yM2 bear the cytoplasmic domains of IL-2R.y with COOH-terminal truncations of 79 and 48 amino acids, respectively. JakI can be detected, both by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C) and in vitro kinase assays (12), in anti-CD4 immunoprecipitates from COS cells cotransfected with the JakI cDNA and the cDNA for CD4f or CD4PA, but not CD4PS. A similar analysis was done for Jak3, which could associate with CD4.y but not with CD4yM1 or CD4-yM2 (Fig. 1C) (12). Protein expression levels of the two Jaks, as well as of the different chimeric receptors, did not vary among the cotransfected COS cells (13). Thus, the cytoplasmic S region of IL-2R3 is required for the association of IL-2R1 with Jakl, whereas the COOH-terminal 48 amino acids of IL2R~y are necessary for the association of IL-2R-y with Jak3. These two regions are known to participate in IL-2-induced cell proliferation (3, 5, 15). It is also worth pointing out that the COOH-terminal region of IL-2Ry is deleted by nonsense mutations in many XSCID patients (6). The utilization of IL-2Ry by a number of receptors (16) explains the activation of Jak3 by IL-4, IL-7, and IL-9 and predicts the activation of Jak3 in response to IL-13 or IL-15 (17). Jakl associated with a region of IL-2R1 that has structural similarity with the corresponding regions of other cytokine receptors (3, 18). A comparable region in the erythropoietin receptor binds Jak2 (19); hence, the membrane proximal region can discriminate among Jaks. We investigated the importance of meras was  these associations in the activation of Jaks  by IL-2. We examined whether Jaks were activated after IL-2 stimulation in a BAFB03-derived cell line, FWT-2, which expresses  both human IL-2Rr  and human  Osaka 565, Japan. 0. Silvennoinen, B. A.

																					<Abstract>Current models of chaperonin-assisted folding suggest that proteins undergo multiple rounds of binding and release before they are released in a form that is committed to folding to the native state. Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we have determined the rates at which rhodanese and glutamine synthetase (GS) are released from groEL in a form committed to refold to active enzyme. Rhodanese and glutamine synthetase were chosen as substrates because they exhibit different solution requirements for the chaperonin system and they form stable "folding arrested" complexes with groEL. At various times during the groE-dependent renaturations, groEL was rapidly removed from the renaturation mixture by immunoprecipitation and centrifugation (30 s). The conformers that are committed to the native state remained in the supernatant and were assayed after 1 h. At 25 degrees C, the rate profiles indicate the release and commitment to folding of GS to its native state occurs far earlier (t1/2 &lt; 1 min) than for rhodanese (t1/2 = 5 min). In light of previous results, it appears that GS monomers can attain a groE-independent assembly competent conformation after a brief interaction with the chaperonin. In contrast, the renaturation rate for rhodanese with the groE chaperonins mirrored the committed renaturation rates following groEL depletion. This suggests that rhodanese must interact with groEL throughout most of its folding reaction before it acquires a folding competent (groE independent) state. If current models of chaperonin mechanism are correct, rhodanese undergoes more rebinding and release cycles than does GS. Structurally, the degree of cycling and hence the rate of commitment to folding to the active form are probably dictated by the hydrophobic nature, number, and lifetimes of the folding intermediates that interact with the chaperonins.</Abstract>

<BodyText>p53 Transcriptional Activation Mediated by Coactivators TAFA40 and TAF,,60 Catherine J. Thut, Jin-Long Chen, Richard Klemm, Robert Tjian The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcriptional regulator that enhances the expression of proteins that control cellular proliferation. The multisubunit transcription factor lID (TEIID) is thought to be a primary target for site-specific activators of transcription. Here, a direct interaction between the activation domain of p53 and two subunits of the TEIID complex, TAF,,40 and TAF,,60, is reported. A double point mutation in the activation domain of p53 impaired the ability of this domain to activate transcription and, simultaneously, its ability to interact with both TAF,,40 and TAF,,60. Furthermore, a partial TEIID complex containing Drosophila TATA binding protein (dTBP), human TAF,,250, dTAF,,60, and dTAF,,40 supported activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion protein in vitro, whereas TBP or a subcomplex lacking TAF,,40 and TAF,,60 did not. Together, these results suggest that TAF,,40 and TAF,,60 are important targets for transmitting activation signals between p53 and the initiation complex.  One mechanism by which the p53 protein appears to function as a tumor suppressor is by inducing the expression of gene products that are responsible for inhibiting or arresting cell growth and proliferation (1). The ability of p53 to regulate transcription of its target genes is critically dependent on both its DNA binding and transcriptional activation domains (2-5). The DNA binding domain appears to be sensitive to disruption by mutation, and most lesions associated with human cancers occur within this domain (6). Functional inhibition of the p53 activation domain also appears to play a role in human tumorigenesis. The product of the MDM2 oncogene, which binds and is believed to mask the activation domain of p53, is overexpressed in certain tumors, resulting in the abrogation of p53 function (7). Although the transcriptional activation domain of p53 appears to be critical for its function as a regulator of cell growth, little is known about how this domain functions to mediate transcriptional activation. The activation domain of p53 lies within the first 73 amino acids of the protein, and some research places it within the first 42 amino acids (3, 5, 8). On the basis of the large number of acidic amino acid residues in this domain, p53 has been classified as a member of the "acidic" group of transcriptional activators (2, 5). Recent studies have provided circumstantial evidence that p53 communicates with the transcriptional machinery by means of a direct interaction with the TATA binding protein (TBP) (9), which is a subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIID (10). In contrast, most wellcharacterized transactivators have been shown to require the presence of the TFIID complex, containing its full complement of TBP-associated factors (TAFs), to stimulate Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, 401 Barker Hall, University of Califomia, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA. 100  transcription (11). To begin to decipher how p53 transmits its activation signal to the basal machinery, we identified functional targets of p53 within the transcription initiation complex. First, to see whether p53 could in fact activate transcription with TBP substituted for the complete TFIID complex, we performed in vitro transcription reactions using a fractionated HeLa cell transcription system. Both full-length p53 and a Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion to the first 42 amino acids of the protein stimulate transcription in vitro using similar systems (3, 12). We produced a recombinant protein containing the Ga14 DNA binding domain fused to two tandem copies of p53 residues 1 to 42 (G4-p53) (Fig. 1A), reasoning that multimerization might make the activation domain more potent. In fractionated HeLa cell extracts, partially purified TFIID but not recombinant human TBP was able to support activation by G4-p53 from a template containing Gal4 sites (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that TBP is not sufficient to mediate activation by this NH2-terminal portion of the p53 activation domain and that at least one of the eight TAFs in the TFIID complex may be essential for transcriptional activation. The TAFs have been proposed to serve as "coactivators" that mediate signals from transcriptional activators to the basal machinery (10, 13). Recent evidence strongly suggests that different classes of activators (for example, acidic, glutamine-rich, and isoleucine-rich) interact with distinct sets of TAFs to transmit their signals (14-16). For example, in vitro interaction and antibody inhibition experiments have suggested that TAFJ140 may mediate the activation signal between VP16, a prototypic member of the acidic class of transactivators, and the basal machinery (14). Given the acidic nature of the activation domain of p53, we asked whether SCIENCE *  A P1 W lag eptop al-94)  ap_53(1-42)Mp53(1  B p53  TBP  TFIID  1  2  3  4  5  6  Fig. 1.

(B) TBP is not sufficient to mediate transcriptional activation by a Gal4-p53 fusion construct. The G4-p53 fusion construct was assayed for its ability to activate transcription in the presence of approximately 0.5 ng of purified hTBP expressed in E. coli (lanes 1 to 3) or partially purified TFIID from HeLa extracts (lanes 4 to 6) by primer extension with the use of a transcription system with fractionated HeLa cells and the G5BCAT template (16, 25).

To determine whether the activation domain of p53 interacts with TAF1140, we coupled a protein containing glutathione-Stransferase (GST) fused to amino acids 1 to 73 of human p53 [GST-p53( 1-73)1 to glutathione-agarose beads. The GST-p53( 173) beads were incubated with crude Escherichia coli lysates containing either Drosophila TAF1140 (dTAF1140) (14) or hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged human TAF1132 protein (hTAF1132), the human homolog of dTAFO14O (17). After extensive washing of the beads, the bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antisera to either dTAF1140 or the HA epitope. GSTp53(1-73) beads, but not control GST beads, efficiently retained both dTAF1140 and hTAF1132 (Fig. 2A). In the reciprocal experiment, the G4-p53(1-42) fusion protein was also able to interact with both GST-dTAF1140 and GST-hTAF1132 (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that the activation domain of p53 can bind selectively to dTAF1140 and to its human counterpart hTAF1132 and that a domain sufficient for TAF1140 interaction resides within the first 42 amino acids of p53.  TAF1140 might also serve as a coactivator of  f il 1111.11.011 El 1.wliawm m  To test the specificity of the p53 TAF1140  interaction, we also deter mrined the infected with recombinant baculovirus (19). ability of other subunits of TFII D to bind Furthermore, by immobilizing the G4p53.

Thus, the activation domain of p53 interacts in vitro with at least two components of the TFIID complex. The functional significance of these interactions, however, remained to be established. Recently, it was shown that a double point mutation in the p53 activation domain that changes a Leu at position 22 to Glu and a Trp at position 23 to Ser impairs the ability of full-length p53 to activate transcription in vivo (20). One explanation for this defect in transcriptional activation is that the mutant may no longer be able to interact with one or more components of the basal transcription machinery. However, the binding of TBP was not affected by the mutations at residues 22 and 23 (20). Having found that this domain of p53 also interacted with TAF1140 and TAF1160, we wanted to determine whether similar point mutations in the activation domain of p53 would affect binding to these TAFs. To this end, an additional vector was engineered that directed expression of a mutant fusion protein (G4-p53mut) in which both copies of the first 42 amino acids of the activation  andd Trp at positions 22 and 23, respectively (Fi: 4A). To ensure that our mutant fusion pro itein recapitulated the transcriptional defec t observed with full-length, mutant p53 in vivo, we assessed the ability of the mutan it fusion protein to stimulate transcriptioi an in vitro in a fractionated HeLa cell tral nscription system using a template contaii ning Ga14 binding sites. Under these in vitl ro transcription conditions, Ga14 alone (G0 4) activated transcription weakly (less tha in twofold), whereas G4-p53 activated trainscription at least eightfold (Fig. 4B). In cor ntrast, G4-p53mut was substantially impai ired in its ability to enhance transcription andd was about as active as the control G4 pro tein (Fig. 4B). These findings are consist rent with previously reported in vivo resultts (20) and confirm that our mutant fusi ion protein is deficient in its ability to  dot main had alanines substituted for the Leu  Lg.  llillilimilsig  UE'll, 0, ..

By contrast, when crude E. co li lysates containing G4p53mut were inctibated with control GST beads, GST-dTAJF,140 beads, or GSThTAF1132 beads, lthe transcriptionally deficient mutant prot ein was not retained (Fig. 3, A and B). Like wise, immobilized G4-p53 but neither G4-p'53mut nor G4 alone was able to retain hTi\F1170 from crude Sf9 cell lysates (Fig. 3C). The correlation between the ability to actisvate transcription and the ability to bind TPkFW140 and hTAF1170 suggested that transcrriptional activation by the NH2-terminal porition of the p53 activation domain might recluire a direct interaction between p53 an(Ld these components of TFIID. To obtain moire decisive evidence that the binding of p533 to TAF1140 and TAF1160 is involved in trariscriptional activation, we assembled partial TFIID complexes in the presence and at)sence of TAF1140 and TAF1160 and teste d their ability to activate transcription by (i4-p53 in vitro. Using a protocol develope(d by Chen et. al. (16), we were able to assemible complexes containing purified, recombiinant dTBP, hTAF11250,  was retained by the GST-dTAF1140 and GST-hTAF1132 fuision proteins but not by  dTAF1160, and dTAF1140. Human TAF11250  serves as a core subunit of TFIID that allows the recruitment of many of the remaining TAFs, including dTAF1160, which in turn helps recruit TAF1140 to the complex (14, 16, 19). We therefore generated three sets of complexes, one containing TBP and TAF11250 (TBP-250), one containing TBP, TAF,1250, and TAF1160 (TBP-250-60), and one containing TBP, TAF11250, TAF,160, and TAF1140 (TBP-250-60-40). A silverstained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the assembled complexes confirmed the presence of the expected subunits (Fig. 5A). Next, a fractionated HeLa cell transcription system was used to test the ability of the in vitro-assembled complexes to direct p53-mediated transcriptional activation. In the presence of purified G4-p53 and the TBP-250 complex, no activation of transcription over the basal level was observed (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2). By contrast, the TBP-250-60-40 complex was capable of supporting a significant amount of p53-dependent activation (three- to fivefold) (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4, and lanes 11 and 12). Importantly, the complex containing only TBP, TAF11250, and TAF1160 also supported transcriptional stimulation by G4-p53 (three- to fivefold) (Fig. 5B, lanes 8 and 9). These results suggest that at least TAF1160 is required for p53-dependent activation in this minimal complex. However, the necessary presence of TAF1160 in TAF1140-containing complexes precludes a direct test of whether TAF1140 alone can also mediate p53-dependent activation. Under the conditions of our reconstituted transcription reaction, we find that Gal4(1-94) protein lacking the p53 activation domain displayed no detectable enhancement of tran scription  with any of the partial complexes (Fig. 5B, lanes 5, 10, and 13). The complete TFIID complex supported G4-p53-dependent activation to a level only twofold greater than that for TBP-250-60-40 (Fig. 5B, lanes 6, 7, 14, and 15) or for TBP-25060 (lanes 8 and 9). For an additional control, we also tested the glutamine-rich activator SpI for its ability to stimulate transcription with the TBP-250-60-40 complex (16). As expected, this complex failed to support Sp 1 -dependent transcription, which suggests that TAF1,40 and TAF1160 do not act as general coactivators of transcription (18). These results, in conjunction with the mutant binding data, strongly suggest that activation of transcription by p53 is at least in part mediated by TAF1140 and TAF1160 and that these TAFs can discriminate between different classes of activators. Here, we have observed an in vitro interaction between a portion of the activation domain of p53 and two components of the transcription machinery, TAF1140 and TAF1160. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a correlation between the ability of this domain to activate transcription and its ability to bind both TAF1140 and TAF1,60. Finally, we have shown that the presence of TAF1160 or of a TAF1140-TAF1160 complex in a partial TFIID assemblage is sufficient to mediate transcriptional activation by a portion of the p53 activation domain. Although it had been previously suggested by several groups that an observed interaction between TBP and p53 might indicate a mechanism in which TBP mediates p53 activation (9), our results support the conclusion that TBP is not sufficient to allow the stimulation of transcription by at least  the NH2-terminal portion of this activation domain. It is possible that full-length p53 contains multiple activation domains that can contact distinct targets in the TFIID complex. We interpret the correlation between the transcriptional defect of the G4p53 fusion protein containing mutations at residues 22 and 23 and its inability to bind TAF1140 and TAF1160 as evidence that both of these TAFs may serve as target coactivators to transmit the activation signal from p53 to the basal transcription machinery. Our data suggest that the binding sites for TAF1140 and TAF1160 reside within the first 42 amino acids of p53, though it is not clear whether these sites are identical or simply overlapping. An alternative explanation for the TAF binding defects of the mutant G4-p53 fusion protein is that residues 22 and 23 are critical to the overall structure of the activation domain. However, TBP, which binds to a similar portion of the p53 activation domain, has been reported to be unaffected by mutations in these residues in the context of the entire p53 protein (20). How p53 and its target TAFs interact with one another during the process of assembly of the transcriptional preinitiation complex is still unknown. If the interaction domains in p53 for TAF1140 and TAF1160 are nonoverlapping, p53 may simultaneously bind both proteins. Such a three-way interaction model is plausible as TAF1140 and TAF1160 appear to directly contact one another in the TFIID complex. It is also possible that p53 binds to only a single TAF and that the specific TAF bound is determined by the presence of other activators competing for binding to either TAF1140 or TAF1160. TAF1140 has been implicated in transcriptional activation by the viral acidic activator VP16. Antibodies directed against TAF1140 selectively inhibit the ability of VP16 to activate transcription in vitro (14). In addition, TAF1,40 has also been shown to interact with other acidic activators, including EBNA-2, an Epstein-Barr virus transactivator (21). A correlation between the ability of wild-type and mutant EBNA-2 proteins to activate transcription and to bind TAF1140 suggests that this interaction may also have functional significance. Recently, we obtained evidence that TAF1160 also interacts with the acidic activation domain of VP16 and that transcriptionally impaired mutants of the VP16 activation domain are also impaired in their ability to bind both TAF1140 and TAF1160 (18). Taken together, these results are consistent with a model in which both TAF1140 and TAF1160 serve as coactivators for at least a subset of acidic transactivators (14). Whether TAF1140 and TAF1160 can simultaneously interact with a single acidic activator or whether the activator can choose the most accessible of the two TAFs is  REFERENCES AND NOTES 1. W. S.

Several proteins that interact with p53 and inhibit the ability of its activation domain to contact the transcription initiation complex have been reported. SV40 T antigen and the hepatitis B virus X protein both appear to block the ability of p53 to bind its DNA site, which decreases the ability of p53 to target normally responsive promoters (22, 23). Alternatively, the cellular oncogene MDM2 appears to directly bind the activation domain of p53 and thus may disrupt the ability of p53 to interact with the basal machinery (7). Through their inhibitory effects on p53 function, these proteins appear to contribute to the transformation of cells (23, 24). Our finding that TAF1140 and TAF1160 cannot bind efficiently to activation domains of p53 containing mutations at residues 22 and 23, taken in combination with the previous observation that mutations in these residues also inhibit the binding of MDM2 to p53 (20), suggests that these proteins vie for binding to a similar region of the activation domain of p53. Thus, an attractive model for the inhibition of p53 function by the MDM2 oncogene may be that MDM2 binding precludes the interaction of p53 with TAF1140 or TAF1160. By dissecting these and other important interactions between p53 and specific functional targets in the transcription complex, we hope to contribute to the eventual understanding of the mechanisms governing p53 activity that will allow the development of therapies to control the cellular effects of p53.

G4(1-94), G4-p53, and G4-p53mut constructs were engineered in a pET 3a vector derivative containing the nucleotide sequence encoding the Flag epitope followed by the first 94 amino acids of the Gal4 DNA binding domain under control of a T7 polymerase promoter and expressed in the E. coli BL21 strain. T7 polymerase expression was induced in these cells with 0.4 mM isopropyl-,B-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 hours. After sonication and centrifugation, fusion proteins used for transcription were purified from the cell lysates by incubation with Flag M2 antibody resin (Eastman Kodak, New Haven, CT) for 4 hours. The resin was washed with binding buffer and binding buffer + 1 M NaCI. We released fusion proteins from the resin by incubating them with Flag peptide (0.2 mg/mI) for 1 hour at 4°C. We standardized relative amounts of the three fusion proteins by assaying their ability to retard the migration of a Gal4 site containing a DNA fragment in nondenaturing gels. In vitro transcription was assayed by primer extension from the G5BCAT template [J. W. Lillie and M. R. Green, Nature 338, 39 (1989)]. Fractionated extracts from HeLa cells were prepared as described [J. Dignam, P. Martin, B. S. Shastry, R. G. Roeder, Methods Enzymol. 101, 582 (1983)] (16). Recombinant dTFIIA protein was used in place of the P.1 fraction [K. Yokomori et al., Genes Dev. 8, 2313 (1994)]. All additions of activators and basal factors were carried out at 40C in the following order: DNA template, activator, TBP or TFIID complex, P.5, DE.1, and dTFIIA. The mixtures were incubated at 300C for 30 min, and transcription was initiated by adding nucleoside triphosphates to a final concentration of 500 ,uM and incubating them an additional 30 min. The reaction products were detected by primer extension, visualized by autoradiagraphy, and  mow-----hTAF1132 coding sequence and then inserting the sequence into the pGEX2TK vector. 27. Q. Zhou, P.

HeLa cell fractions P.1/D.3(11A) and P.5 were added and incubated at 3O°C for 30 min. Transcription was initiated by addition of nucleotides [500 mM adenosine triphosphate and cytidine triphosphate and 25 mM [cx-32P]uridine triphosphate (UTP); 5 mCi per reaction] and allowed to proceed for 15 min.

Berardi, Anlai Wang, James D. Levine, Peter Lopez, David T. Scadden* Hematopoietic cells differentiate in steps marked by the acquisition or loss of specific phenotypic characteristics. Human bone marrow cells that were responsive to the earlyacting cytokines Kit ligand and interleukin-3 were forced to a metabolic death. The subfraction remaining represented 1 in 1 05 bone marrow mononuclear cells, was determined to be quiescent by cell cycle analysis, and had a stem cell immunophenotype. The cells were highly enriched for long-term culture-initiating cells, were capable of secondary colony formation, and produced both myeloid and lymphoid progeny. Thus, this technically simple strategy led to the efficient purification of cells with characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells.  The efficient isolation of hematopoietic stem cells would enhance both the investigation of the processes of lineage commitment and self-renewal and the clinical strategies of bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy with hematopoietic cells. The fraction of human bone marrow that is CD34+, CD33-, CD38-, human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) DR-, Thy-1''O, negative for lineage-specific antigens, and stains lightly with the dye rhodamine-123 is enriched for repopulating stem cells (1, 2). However, methods that depend on cell sorting require considerable mechanical manipulation of the cells, and antibody binding to cell surface structures may induce perturba tions  of the cells' physiology. Other enrichment methods have been based on functional characteristics of cells, including soybean agglutinin binding (3) and resistance to either the alkylating agent 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (4-He) (4) or the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (5). However, these methods result in persistent heterogeneity within the selected cell population. We reasoned that by combining cytokine stimulation with antimetabolite treatment, we could induce cell death in responding cells and therefore select for cells resistant to the proliferative effects of the cytokines. The earliest identifiably committed progenitor cells respond to Kit ligand  (KL) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) and have been identified as primitive cells capable of forming high proliferative capacity colonies type 1 (HPP-CFC-1), an in vitro marker of a very primitive myeloid cell (6). Because the IL-3 receptor is not thought to be present on the hematopoietic stem cell (7), we incubated these cells with KL and IL-3 in the presence of serum plus 5-FU for a prolonged period to functionally select for primitive stem cells. We assessed the selection technique by flow cytometric analysis with DNA staining dyes (Fig. 1). When either bulk bone marrow mononuclear preparations or bone marrow cells selected with CD34+ immunobeads were used, the selection strategy efficiently eliminated cells in the S or G2-M phase. Remaining cells were shown to be in the Go phase by staining with the ribosomal RNA dye Pyronin Y (Polysciences, Warrington, Pennsylvania). Testing a number of different selection strategies, we determined that the maximal efficiency was attained when high concentrations of 5-FU were used (&amp;gt;200 ,ug/ml) and when selection was continued for at least 7 days. At high concentrations, 5-FU inhibits RNA splicing as well as DNA synthesis and may therefore act to more effectively eliminate metabolically activated cells (8). We evaluated whether our selection had isolated cells resistant to the proliferative effects of KL and IL-3 by use of the fluorescent membrane dye PKH26, which is stable Day 0 Day 7  Fig. 1. Cell cycle status of CD34+-selected or unselected bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells cultured under control or 5-FU-selected conditions (23). Cells were stained with propidium iodide (Pl) and Hoechst 33342 (HO) (Sigma) (24) and then analyzed by flow cytometry on days 0 and 7. HO staining intensity varies with DNA content and increases as cells transit from GO-G1 into the S and G2-M phases of the cell cycle. PI staining increases with either loss of viability (Pimod hi' HO10) or as cells undergo the S, G2, and M phases (P1mod hi' HOmodh). Under control conditions, the full spectrum of the cell cycle was represented as indicated by variable HO staining, with more nonviable cells (pimod hi' HO10) present after the 7-day incubation period, which results from terminally differentiated cells in liquid culture. However, the 5-FU-treated cells are restricted to HO10 staining and had an increased proportion of nonviable cells. A remaining small subpopulation of viable cells (P110, HO10) in the 5-FU-treated cultures was confirmed by trypan blue exclusion analysis. Similar results were obtained with either CD34+-selected (bottom) or bulk preparations of bone marrow mononuclear cells (top). 104  Control  5-FU  I  P1  SCIENCE  *  VOL. 267  *  6 JANUARY 1995  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on November 6, 2009  </BodyText></FullTextData>

																						<Abstract>Platelet glycoproteins alpha IIb and beta 3 are membrane proteins that associate to form a Ca(2+)-dependent heterodimer which constitutes an inducible member of the integrin family at the surface of the cell. To produce a soluble form of this complex, alpha IIb and beta 3 were both deleted of their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and were expressed in COS cells. Production of the truncated subunits and their mode of assembly were examined by immunoprecipitation experiments and compared to those of wild-type alpha IIb beta 3. Synthesis and processing of the truncated heterodimer proceeded via a pathway similar to that observed for the wild-type alpha IIb beta 3 in COS cells or in human megakaryocytes. The truncated beta 3 subunit associated with the Pro-truncated form of the alpha IIb subunit. This precursor form was not secreted. After proteolytic cleavage of the Pro-truncated alpha IIb, the mature heterodimer was secreted into the culture supernatant. To quantify the molar ratio of the various secreted soluble forms, an immunocapture assay was designed. All secreted tr-alpha IIb subunits associated with tr-beta 3. In contrast, tr-beta 3 was produced and secreted in excess as the free form. Immunoreactivity of the wild-type and soluble truncated complexes was identical since all the monoclonal antibodies used reacted with surface-located epitopes on both complexes. This indicated that the soluble truncated heterodimer adopted a native conformation. To purify this soluble heterodimer, tr-alpha IIb beta 3-containing culture supernatant was adsorbed on an RGDW-affinity column and eluted with a solution of the free peptide RGDW.

To produce a soluble form of this complex, aIIb and p3 were both deleted of their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and were expressed in COS cells.

For both complexes, these interactions were mediated by RGD and y fibrinogen signals. Keywords. Integrin, aIIbp3 ; soluble form; aIIbp3 integrin.  Platelet glycoprotein IIbIIIa is a member of the p3 integrin subfamily which functions as a receptor for adhesive proteins at the surface of platelet. The molecule has a loose specificity as it interacts with various multivalent adhesive proteins including fibrinogen [l, 21, von Willebrand factor [3], fibronectin [4] and vitronectin [5]. The glycoproteins IIb (or aIIb) and IIIa (or 83) subunits are synthesized separately in the megakaryocyte which is the precursor cell of a platelet in the bone marrow. The p3 subunit is produced in excess and stored, while the aIIb subunit is produced as a precursor form and is immediately associated with the p3 subunit prior to its proteolytic maturation and its expression at the surface of the cell [6].Neither of the subunits alone is surface-exposed or secreted. They form a calcium-dependent heterodimer and are exclusively implicated in platelet adhesion and aggregation. aIIb/33 exemplifies a typical integrin which is sensitive to the peptide RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp). Two series of peptides have been shown to interfere with both its ligand-binding capacity and its adhesive functions. Synthetic peptides with the motif Correspondence to D. Gulino, Commissariat i 1'Energie Atomique, Laboratoire d'HCmatologie, Institut National de la SantC et de la Recherche MCdicale Unitt 217, Dtpartement de Biologie MolCculaire et Structurale, Centre d'Etudes NuclCaires, F-38041 Grenoble, France Abbreviation. D-RGDW, D-Arg-Gly-L-Asp-L-Trp.  KQAGDV, corresponding to the C-terminus of the fibrinogen y chain, interact directly with the heterodimer and block its function [7-101. The molecule also recognizes the RGD signal and synthetic peptides containing this tripeptide motif have also been shown to interact directly with the heterodimer and to be mutually exclusive with the fibrinogen y chain peptide [lo, 111. All the adhesive proteins interacting with aIIbp3 contain one or several RGD sequences. The KQAGDV motif, however, is unique to fibrinogen which remains the privileged ligand for the aggregation reaction in plasma. Though fibrinogen contains two sets of RGD sequences, both located in the a chain of the molecule, two recent and independent studies have suggested that this motif does not function as a recognition signal. Recombinant fibrinogen molecules with mutated RGD sequences did not lose their capacity to aggregate platelets whereas mutations of the KQAGDV sequence were lethal for the adhesive properties of the molecule [32]. On the other hand, electron microscope studies have shown that isolated aIIbp3 interacts with the fibrinogen molecule via the N-terminal globular domain [13]. These recent observations are open to argument since they did not account for the stoichiometry and the affinity of the reaction. They are, however, in agreement with earlier studies showing that a plasmin degradation fragment D which does not contain RGD sequences was able to block completely both fibrinogen binding  Gulino et al. (EUK Biochem. 227) J.  109  and platelet aggregation [14, 151 and to displace von Willebrand factor from activated platelet 1161. Thus the y chain motif is likely to be a specific and unique recognition signal for this integrin. Yet, RGD peptides are potent inhibitors of platelet function and have been used as a motif to design new peptidomimetics with antithrombotic activity. This enigma will be definitively solved when the three-dimensional structure of a functional aIIbp3 is known. To address this issue, molecular variants of this integrin which might be suitable for crystallization should be produced. Expression of a functional receptor was initially performed by transfection of full length cDNAs encoding the aIIb and 8 3 subunits into heterologous cells [17-201. Cotransfection of the full-length cDNAs into COS cells results in a proteolytically processed aIIb subunit that associates with p3 to form a heterodimeric complex and this association is a requisite for the transport to the cell surface [18, 191. Recent studies from Bennett and colleagues [21] have analysed the cellular traffic of truncated forms of the aIIb and p3 subunits which did not contain the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain and have shown that these truncated mutants were able to form a secretable heterodimer. These studies have also shown that both subunits contain intracellular retention signals within their transmembrane or cytoplasmic domain and that additional retention signals are present in the extracellular domain of the aIIb subunit. While these initial studies have indicated that production of a soluble form of aIIbp3 is feasible, they did not indicate whether these truncated forms retain their capacities to interact with fibrinogen. In the present paper, we have used a similar strategy to produce and purify a functional and water-soluble form of aIIbp3. We show that this purified truncated heterodimer expresses a fibrinogen-binding capacity that mimics that of the native receptor.

All DNA constructs are derived from the full-length cDNA plasmids pECEaIIb and pECEp3 [20]. The expression plasmid coding for the aIIb mutant lacking the transmembrane and the intracellular regions was named pECEtr-aIIb and was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. A 1008-bp cDNA fragment generated by digestion of pECEaIIb with NruI and EcoRI was first subcloned into the M13 mp19 vector. The primer 5'-GATTGGAATTCACCTCTCCTC-3' was used to incorporate a stop codon at position 2980. After a subsequent digestion with BamHI and EcoRI, a 493-bp cDNA fragment containing the selected mutation was obtained and subcloned back into pECEaIIb (Fig. 1A). p3 mutant, deleted from both transmembrane and intracellular domains, was designated pECEtr-p and was constructed as previously described [20]. The resulting expression vectors pECEtr-aIIb and pECEtr-p contained the coding regions for the extracellular domains of aIIb (nucleotides 1-2979) and p3 (nucleotides 1-2154). The truncated proteins expressed by these constructs were called tr-aIIb and tr-p3. To generate an expression vector coding for both tr-aIIb and tr-P3, a unique SphI-Eco47-111 fragment was generated from pECEtr-aIIb and inserted into the pECEtr-B3 previously digested by the blunt-end-generating enzyme Eco47 1 1 The resulting 1. plasmid pECEtr-aIIbp3 contained upstream and downstream the tr-aIIb and tr$3 coding sequences, a promotor and a poly(A) signal (Fig. ZB).

The Pro-aIIb subunit contains a proteolytic cleavage site which is used to generate the mature form of the aIIb. The construction pECEtraIIb coding for tr-aIIb subunit was amputated from residue Ala963 to residue Glu1008 by directed mutagenesis on a full-length aIIb cDNA and the introduction of a stop codon at position 963. Similarly, the construction pECEtr-/B contained a deletion from residue Ile693 to residue Thr762 with a stop codon at position 693.

(Eul: J. Biochern. 227) night dialysis against NaCVP, at 4°C. Dialysate was then centrifuged and the protein concentration determined. To control the biotinylation reaction, an ELISA assay in which the plates were precoated with an anti-(human fibrinogen) polyclonal antibody (DAKO) was designed. Increasing amounts of biotinylated protein were added to these antibody-coated plates. Bound fibrinogen was detected using various dilutions of streptavidin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer). Based on the highest specific absorbance obtained, a 1/5000 streptavidin dilution was selected. In these conditions, concentrations of fibrinogen ranging over 1-2000 ng/ml could be easily detected. In control experiments, it was verified that the biotinylation did not modify the capacity of fibrinogen to aggregate ADP-stimulated platelets. Quantification of the tr-aIIbp3 secretion by an immunocapture assay. Microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4°C with the polyclonal anti-aIIbp3 antibody P23 dissolved in 0.1 M sodium hydrogencarbonate pH 9.1. The plates were then saturated with NaCl/P, containing 1% BSA. Increasing amounts of aIIbp3 or tr-aIIbp3 were added to the wells. Dilutions of aIIbp3 were performed either in culture medium or in buffer B depending on the nature of the tr-aIIbp3 dilution. Bound aIIbp3-derived complexes were detected using the two aIIbp3-complex-specific, CS3 and CS9, the aIIb-specific D33C and the /%specific B2A monoclonal antibodies. After washing with buffer B, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Dakopatts) was then incubated for 1 h. Binding was quantitated using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate for alkaline phosphatase and measuring the absorbance at 410 nm. Nonspecific binding was estimated with non-immune IgG or in the absence of any aIIbp3 complex. Fibrinogen binding. An immunocapture assay was designed to measure fibrinogen binding. The wells of the microtiter plates were coated with 20 pg/ml of aIIbp3 complex-specific monoclonal antibody, CS3, overnight at 4°C in 0.1 M NaHCO, pH 9.1. The wells were filled in with solutions containing D-RGDWpurified platelet aIIbp3 or secreted tr-aIIbp3 for an additional overnight incubation. The plates were saturated with buffer B containing 35 mg/ml BSA for 3 h, washed three times with buffer B and varying concentrations of biotinylated fibrinogen were incubated for 4 h. Streptavidin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer) was added for an additional 1 h. The wells were washed three times with buffer B and color development was measured following addition of the alkaline phosphatase substrate. In some experiments, peptides RGDW, RGGW, HLGGAKQAGDV (H11) and its acetylated form (acet-Hll), were used as competitors and were mixed with fibrinogen prior to incubation with immunocaptured heterodimers. Peptide synthesis. Peptides were synthezised using standard solid-phase methodology. Deprotection and cleavage of the peptides from the resin were performed at 0°C for 1 h with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride containing 10% thioanisole. Peptides were lyophilized, gel filtered on Sephadex G-10 and purified by HPLC using a C , ODs2 column and a 0-80% linear acetoni, trile gradient in 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid.  proteins were isolated using a concanavalin-A- Sepharose affinity column. Fractions eluted from this column with methyl a-Dmannose were pooled and passed through a heparin -Sepharose column to remove thrombospondin. The non-absorbed glycoproteins were concentrated to a volume of 10 ml and subjected to gel filtration using Sephacryl S-300. The eluted aIIbp3 was dialysed extensively against buffer B (150 mM NaC1, l mM CaCl,, 1 mM MgCl,, 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4) according to a method previously described [23]. Antibodies. Four monoclonal antibodies directed against distinct aIIb and p3 epitopes were utilized. CS3 and CS9 were two aIIbp3-complex-specific antibodies. D33C was directed against the fourth calcium binding site of the aIIb subunit [24]. B2A was an anti-P3 subunit and was shown to be specific for its nonreduced form. This monoclonal antibody blocked platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding (unpublished results). The four monocIonal IgGs were purified from ascitic fluids using an octanoic method and ammonium sulfate precipitation [25]. A polyclonal antibody named P23 was raised against purified platelet aIIbp3. Transfection of COS cells. Electroporation using the BioRad gene pulser system was used to introduce the pECE expression vectors containing clones of aIIb or p3 wild or truncated cDNA (20 pg) into COS cells. After electroporation, cells were grown in 45 ml 10% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium. Optimal secretion was obtained when cotransfection was performed with 7X lo6 cells. Cotransfection with varying amounts of cDNAs did not improve the production. The plasmid pECEtr-aIIbp3 containing the truncated aIIb and p3 cDNAs was also transfected into 7X106 COS cells. Immunoprecipitation of the recombinant aIIbm-derived complexes. Immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described [20] using the monoclonal antibody B2A. Detection of the secreted complex was performed on 1 m supernatant l from cells transfected with the truncated cDNAs. Affinity purification of the secreted tr-aIIbB complex. The affinity matrix was prepared by incubating 100 mg D-ArgGly-Asp-Trp (d-RGDW) with 10 ml activated CH-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). The spacer arm amino-l-carboxyl-5-pentane, was used to facilitate contact between the immobilized peptide and the protein to be purified. Cells (7X lo6) transfected with the expression vector PECEtr-aIIbp3 were grown in 175-cm2 culture flasks; 70 h after transfection, supernatants were collected, centrifuged and kept at 4°C before affinity chromatography on a D-RGDW column. tr-aIIbp3-containing supernatant (500 ml) was applied on a 5-ml dRGDW affinity column. Bound tr-aIIbp3 complex was successively eluted with 6 mM D-RGGW or D-RGDW dissolved in buffer B. The purified tr-aIIbp3 was extensively dialysed at 4°C in buffer B to remove the tetrapeptides. The same procedure was applied on platelets aIIbp3 eluted from Sephacryl S-300. After dialysis, the absence of peptide was controlled by measuring the absorbance of the protein solution at 260 nm. In a second type of experiment, metabolically 35S-labelled tr-aIIbp3-containing supernatants were applied on a 1-ml RGDW affinity column. To detect the presence of the truncated complex, the passthrough and the RGGW- and RGDW-eluted materials were then analyzed by B2A immunoprecipitation. Biotinylation of proteins. D-Biotinoyl-aminohexanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Boehringer, catalog number 1008960) dissolved in dimethylformamide was added in 16 fold molar excess to 10 nmol fibrinogen diluted in 1 ml phosphatebuffered saline (NaCl/P,: 140 mM NaC1, 2 mM KCl, 8 mM Na,HPO,, 1.5 i f i KH,PO,, pH 7). The solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 h and the pH of the reaction mixture ajusted to 7.4. Unreacted biotin ester was removed by an over RESULTS  Production of a soluble form of aIIbp3. To produce a soluble form of the integrin aIIbp3, stop codons were introduced within the sequence of full-length cDNAs coding for each subunit, at nucleotide positions which allowed deletion of the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane domains (Fig. 1A). In preliminary experiments, cDNAs were introduced independently in the pECE expression vector and cotransfected into COS cells to produce  Gulino et al. (ELM Biochern. 227) J.  111  Pro-tr-aIIbP3 (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 6). This suggested that proteolytic cleavage of the wild and truncated precursor forms induced a conformational change at the subunit interface.  Fig. 2. Immunoprecipitation of the wild and truncated aIIbp3 complexes produced in transfected COS cells. pECE constructs containing cDNAs encoding the wild-type or the truncated forms of aIIb and 8 3 subunits were used to transfect COS-7 cells. Recombinant proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-/n B2A (lanes 1, 2, 4, 5 ) and the anti complex-specific CS3 monoclonal antibodies (lanes 3, 6). Lanes 1 and 4, immunoprecipitation pattern obtained with aIIb and p3 full-length cDNAs; lanes 2, 3, 5, 6, transfection with the cDNA construct coexpressing tr-aIIb and tr-/n.  the truncated forms of each subunit and to examine their mode of assembly. Production of tr-aIIbp3 was examined by B2Aimmunoprecipitation experiments both on cell extracts and cell supernatants. Results of the experiments with cotransfected cDNAs were unfortunately quantitatively irreproducible, highly dependent on the transfection efficiency of each cDNA and were not improved by varying the cDNA ratio (results not shown). Thus, the two truncated cDNAs were both incorporated into the same pECE expression vector (Fig. 1B). In these conditions, expression and processing of the truncated heterodimer proceeded via the same pathways. The results, however, were more reproducible and three times as many truncated complexes were produced and secreted as estimated by an immunocapture solidphase assay (results not shown). Consequently, the second pECE construct containing both truncated cDNAs was used in subsequent experiments. Formation of the truncated heterodimer tr-aIIbp and wildtype a I I b p complex were compared. Consistent with previously published observations, the wild-type aIIbp3 was produced in COS cells via pathways which were similar to those observed in human megakaryocyte [6]. Free p3 as well as ProaIIb and aIIb-associated P3 were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts by B2A (Fig. 2, lane 1).Electrophoretic mobilities of the immunoprecipitated bands were consistent with expected molecular masses for the 130-kDa precursor form and the 116-kDa mature form of the aIIb as well as the 100-kDa p subunits. These control experiments further confirmed the absence of secreted aIIbp3 complex in the supernatant of transfected COS cells (Fig. 2, lane 4). Production and processing of the tr-aIIbfl proceeded via similar pathways. The tr-/33 subunit was produced with a molecular mass of 90 kDa, a value consistent with the expected value derived from the sequencing of the tr-cDNA (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 5 and 6). This tr-p3 subunit was B2A-immunoprecipitated together with a Pro-tr-aIIb of 125 kDa from cell extracts (lane 2) and a tr-aIIb of 116 kDa from cell supernatants (lane 5). The difference in molecular mass between Pro-tr-aIIb and tr-aIIb was consistent with the proteolytic transition between the proform and the mature form of the mutant and corresponded to the molecular mass derived from DNA sequencing. These results indicated that the precursor form of the tr-aIIbj33 heterodimer remained in the cells, while the mature truncated complex was completely secreted. In megakaryocytes, the complex-specific monoclonal antibody CS3 immunoprecipitated the mature aIIbP3 and not the precursor form (results not shown). Similarly, CS3 immunoprecipitated the soluble cleaved heterodimer tr-aIIbP3 but not the  Quantitation and conformational status of tr-aIIbpcT. Consistent with our previous observations, the p3 subunit was produced in excess. Similarly, the tr-,83 was present in excess in both cell extracts and supernatants as indicated by the relative intensity of the B2A-immunoprecipitated electrophoretic bands (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 5). To quantitate the presence of free and associated tr$3 in the supernatant, an immunocapture assay was designed. In this assay, microtiter plates were precoated with an anti-(purified aIIbp3) polyclonal antibody, P23, to capture the antigen. Quantitation of the antigen was achieved with a second monoclonal antibody specific for either the aIIb, the P3 subunits or the heterodimer aIIbp3. The anticomplex monoclonal antibodies CS3 and CS9 were used to detect the formation of the heterodimer. Free or associated tr-aIIb were detected with the antiaIIb monoclonal antibody D33C. Free or associated tr-P3 were detected with the monoclonal antibody B2A. Standard curves obtained with these antibodies tested with different concentrations of purified aIIbp3 are illustrated in Fig. 3. Non-specific background was estimated with nonimmune IgGs and averaged 30-40% of maximal value. With a more than 50% non-specific binding, B2A was different from the other antibodies. The results were consistent over a series of five independent experiments and the curves were used to quantitate the molar ratio of the various secreted soluble forms. Data shown in Fig. 4 illustrate the time course for the secretion of the different subunits. These results are expressed in aIIbP3 equivalents. Consistent with the intensity of the immunoprecipitated bands, all the tr-aIIb subunits were associated with t r - p while a sevenfold excess of free tr-P3 was produced and secreted (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 5). To confirm the presence of free trP3 in the supernatant, transfection experiments were performed with the tr-P3 cDNA construct alone. Immunoprecipitation with cell supernatant using the P3-specific antibody B2A indicated that tr-P3 can indeed be secreted without being associated with the aIIb subunit. In contrast, there was no secretion of the tr-aIIb subunit when produced alone (data not shown). In subsequent experiments, to restrict the production of unassociated p3 subunit, tr-aIIb/33-containing supernatants were collected 70 h after transfection (Fig. 4). From these results, we concluded that all the tr-aIIb molecules produced are implicated in the formation of an heterodimer with tr-P3 while a large excess of tr-j33 remains unassociated even in the supernatant. All the monoclonal antibodies used in these experiments reacted with surface-located epitopes either on isolated subunits (B2A, D33C), or on the mature form of the integrin complex (CS3 and CS9). Thus, immunoreactivities of the wild-type and the soluble truncated molecules are similar, indicating that their conformational status is likely to be comparable. Purification of tr-aIIbpLT. To purify the tr-aIIbp3 complex, a peptide column was made with the tetrapeptide D-RGDW which was reported to have the highest affinity for the wild-type aIIbp3 integrin [26]. In preliminary experiments, metabolically radiolabelled supernatants were applied on this D-RGDW column. To elute the adsorbed material, D-RGGW and D-RGDW peptide solutions were successively passed through the column. Purification of the complex was followed by B2A-immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown on Fig. 5, a 90-kDa band corresponding to the free form of tr-p3 was detected in the passthrough, suggesting that this unassociated subunit was not retained on the DRGDW column (lane 1). Whereas no protein was eluted by the  112  Gulino et al. (Eul: J.

Detection of the bound aIIbp3 fraction was assayed using the aIIbp3 complex-specific and CS9 monoclonal antibodies (+) (A), or with the aIIbCS3 (H) specific D33C (X) and the /TJ-specific B2A (+) monoclonal antibodies (B). Nonspecific binding was determined by replacing the above-mentioned antibodies by a mouse non-immune IgG preparation (0,NI). Anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was then added for an additional hour. Using the four monoclonal-antibody-specific curves, the composition of the complex tr-aIIbp3 could then be evaluated.  Fig. 5. Purification of the truncated complex. 7X106 COS cells were transfected with pECEtr-aIIbp3 and metabolically labelled as previously described [20]. The 35S-labelled supernatant was passed through a 1ml RGDW-affinity column. Following extensive washing, RGGW and RGDW peptide solutions were applied onto the column. The composition of the passthrough (lane 1) and the RGGW-eluted (lane 2) and RGDW-eluted (lane 3) fractions were analyzed by B2A immunoprecipitations.  D-RGGD solution (lane 2), the 90-kDa tr-p3 and the 116-kDa tr-aIIb subunits were observed on the RGDW-eluted material (lane 3). The comparable intensity of the B2A-immunoprecipitated bands seen on lane 3 suggested that the truncated subunits were effectively detached from the RGDW-affinity column as a complex. To confirm these observations, the passthrough as well as the eluted material were quantitated using the immunocapture assay on P23-coated plates. The purification protocol was first validated with purified aIIblyJ. Table 1 summarizes the results obtained for one purification run and illustrates different independent experiments. When 600 ml culture supernatant containing a total of 29 pg tr-aIIbp3 was applied, no truncated complex was detected in the flowthrough, indicating that the recombinant complex could be quantitatively absorbed on the peptide column. After multiple washings, D-RGGW did not elute any material from the column. In contrast, 2 pg tr-aIIblyJ were recovered with D-RGDW-containing solution which corresponded to 7 % of the absorbed material. In the D-RGDW-eluted material, the amount of each subunit was stoichiometric, suggesting that the complex was not dissociated. This demonstrated that the af finity  column was able to separate the free tr$3 from the traIIbp3 complex, indicating that the absorbed material was functionally active. Thus, to evaluate the capacity of the soluble traIIbp3 to interact with adhesive proteins, functional assays were performed.  Ligand-binding assays. Ligand-binding assays were designed to evaluate the capacity of the D-RGDW-purified tr-aIIbj33 to interact with fibrinogen. Plastic wells were coated with the complex-specific monoclonal antibody CS3 to immunocapture either purified aIIbp3 or tr-aIIblyJ. Using biotinylated fibrinogen, interaction of fibrinogen with the adsorbed material was monitored. In preliminary experiments, binding of a constant fibrinogen concentration was measured as a function of tr-aIIbP amounts immunocaptured. Binding was dose-dependent and saturable with respect to the receptor concentration (results not shown). Next, binding of fibrinogen to tr-aIIbp3 and to platelet aIIbp3 were compared (Fig. 6A). Binding was measured as a  Gulino et al. ( E m J. Biochem. 227)  113  Table 1. Purification of tr-aIIbp3 using a D-RGDW affinity column. 2 ml metabolically 35S-labelled tr-aIIbfl-containing supernatant were eluted on a D-RGDW affinity column.

Again binding with soluble fibrinogen was saturable. Non-specific interaction was measured on albumincoated wells. Half saturation was obtained with 0.5 nM purified aIIbp3 compared to 0.3 nM tr-aIIbp3, suggesting that the affinity of the variant molecule for fibrinogen was slightly increased. In control experiments, it was verified that platelet a I I b P needed to be eluted from a RGD column to bind fibrinogen. Thus, the possibility that activation of the heterodimers could result from the immunocapture on CS3 was excluded. Furthermore, incubation of the D-RGDW-eluted tr-aIIbp3 complex with 10 m 4 EDTA completely prevented fibrinogen h binding (Fig. 6A). Under this EDTA condition, irreversible dissociation of platelet aIIbp3 has been reported. Consequently, it could be concluded that integrity of the recombinant complex was required for high affinity binding of fibrinogen. To verify the specificity of the interaction between tr-aIIbp3 and fibrinogen, the anti-functional monoclonal antibody B2A was used as a competitor (Fig. 6B). This antibody was demonstrated to both inhibit fibrinogen binding to aIIbp3 and platelet aggregation (unpublished work). In the solid-phase assay, 5 nM B2A IgG was preincubated with the immunocaptured complexes. This concentration was sufficient to completely block the specific interaction of fibrinogen to immobilized aIIbp3. Similarly, this antibody produced a total inhibition of fibrinogen binding to tr-aIIbp3. No effect was observed with non-immune IgGs. Finally, inhibition of fibrinogen binding to both receptors with synthetic peptides corresponding to the fibrinogen a chain sequence RGD and to the fibrinogen y chain sequence HLGGAKQAGDV ( H l l ) was also examined in the solid-phase immunocapture assay previously described. At 100 nM, the peptide D-RGDW produced a 65 % inhibition of fibrinogen binding to aIIbp3, whereas the D-RGGW peptide was inactive (Fig. 6B). Likewise, D-RGDW produced a 70% inhibition of fibrinogen binding to tr-aIIbp3 whereas D-RGGW did not inhibit the interaction. Similar results were obtained with the peptide HI1 at a 1.2 pM concentration (Fig. 6B).

Biochem. 227) umn, using the peptide D-RGDW which has been reported to be one of the most potent inhibitors of aIIbp3 function [26]. Following affinity chromatography, the truncated heterodimer was concentrated fivefold. The fact that the secreted heterodimer was absorbed on an RGD-affinity column and eluted by the peptide D-RGDW indicates that tr-aIIbp3 exhibits the appropriate functional structure and recognizes RGD-derived sequences. This was further supported by ligand binding experiments which indicated that the recombinant tr-aIIbp3 and platelet aIIbp3 interacted with fibrinogen with similar affinity. An increased avidity for the ligand was, however, observed with tr-aIIbp3. This is consistent with the observation that aIIbp3 has a greater affinity for fibrinogen when the cytoplasmic domain of the aIIb subunit is deleted [31]. Like its native homologue, tr-aIIbp3 recognizes fibrinogen via its RGD and y recognition signals. Taken together with the immunoreactivity study, this indicates that the soluble heterodimer adopts a competent conformational state. It has recently been reported that the binding of RGD-containing peptides to aIibp3 leads to changes in this integrin that are associated with the acquisition of high-affinity fibrinogen-binding function [32, 331, in agreement with the observation that DRGDW-purified aIIbp3 maintained a competent binding state. The ligand-binding properties of the truncated heterodimer may thus be induced by the D-RGDW-affinity chromatography. Spontaneous activity, however, cannot be ruled out. In any case, the present study demonstrates that the production and the purification of an active soluble form of this integrin is feasible. Further crystallization of this form in the presence of synthetic peptides may constitute the next step towards the understanding of ligand-receptor interaction in the integrin family. Recently, Steiner et al. [34] produced, using a baculovirus insect cell expression system, a functional aIIbp3 heterodimer consisting of the truncated p3 1-469 and aIIb 1-874 subunits. Although this complex exhibited an affinity for fibrinogen similar to that of the native receptor, a disparity in the molecular mass of the truncated subunit nIIb was observed. This can be explained by the underglycosylation of this subunit. Indeed, it is well known that in the baculovirus expression system, processing of complex oligosaccharides did not occur. On the contrary, our mammalian-cell-expressed heterodimer underwent a correct glycosylation. Furthermore, this secreted recombinant complex was normally processed as the proteolytic cleavage occurred on its aIIb subunit. Consequently, this truncated complex possessed a tridimensional structure which should exactly mimic that of the native receptor. To become well-adapted for future crystallization studies, the production of this heterodimer should be improved by, for example, establishing a stable cell line expressing the recombinant tr-aIIbp3.  petent to bind fibrinogen with high affinity and adopted a conformation mimicking that of native activated aIIbp3.  DISCUSSION The present study describes the synthesis, the purification and the functional analysis of a water-soluble form of the platelet integrin aIIbp3. To optimize the expression of this complex, an expression vector containing truncated cDNAs encoding the tr-aiIb and tr-fl, both deleted of their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, was constructed. When COS cells were transfected with this construct, both subunits were expressed with the expected molecular mass. tr-aIIb was produced as a Protr-aIIb corresponding to the single-chain precursor form of the truncated a subunit. This Protr-aIIb was able to form a complex with tr-P3. When associated with the tr-P3, the Protr-aIIb was processed into a two-polypeptide chain tr-aIIb subunit. These results are consistent with our previous studies on the expression of the wild-type aIIb and p3 cDNAs in COS cells [20] and indicate that tr-aIIb and tr-fl can be expressed and form a heterodimer via processing mechanisms that are similar to the biosynthetic pathways observed in megakaryocytes [6]. A quantitative analysis of our experiments indicated the presence of an excess of tr$3 both in cell extracts and in cell supernatants. This is consistent with the presence of a stored pool of p3 subunit in megakaryocyte [6]. The structure of the extracellular domain of the 8 3 subunit is very rich in disulfide bridges and may explain a protection against metabolic degradation and a greater stability compared to the aIIb subunit. Alternatively, differences in the production of the two subunits may be attributed to differences in mRNA stability. Nevertheless, the results indicate that all truncated aIib subunits are involved in the formation of soluble and secretable heterodimers and that the stability of this subunit may be the limiting parameter for the quantitative production of such complexes. Moreover, the mature tr-aIIbp3 heterodimer was only detected in cell supernatants, suggesting that this complex was immediately and completely secreted. The soluble truncated form reacted with different complexspecific monoclonal antibodies and with antibodies directed against epitopes located on nIIb or p3. This suggests that the immunoreactivity of the wild-type and the truncated complexes are similar and that their conformational status may be identical. The complex-specific antibody CS3 was unable to recognize the precursor forms Protr-aIIbp3 and Pro-aIIbp3 in cell extracts, suggesting that the proteolytic cleavage of the Pro-aIIb subunit may induce a subtle conformational change proximal to the complex subunit interface since CS3 was able to immunoprecipitate the mature tr-aIIbp3. Since tr-aIIb alone was not secreted, it is likely that formation of the heterodimer and this induced conformational transition are requisite reactions for secretion of the complex. This does not seem to be unique to aIIbp3 as other truncated integrins have been produced with similar observations [27, 281. A general conclusion to these studies is that neither the cytoplasmic domain nor the transmembrane domain are necessary for the formation of integrin heterodimers and that the structural signal required for interactions between the two subunits are located in the extracellular domain. All these results are in agreement with those of Bennett and colleagues [21] who cotransfected COS cells with two separate expression vectors each containing a cDNA coding for either truncated GPIIb or truncated GPIIIa. However, these authors did not establish the functionality of their recombinant heterodimer. We were able to purify the soluble tr-aIIbp3 from cell supernatants by affinity chromatography on a Sepharose-peptide col REFERENCES I.  Bennett, J. S. &amp; Vilaire, G . (1979) J. Clin.

																							<Abstract>The 72-kDa spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Src-family kinase p53/56Lyn (Lyn) contribute to signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor complex. Here we show that Syk and Lyn from human B lymphocytes can interact directly. Syk and Lyn coimmunoprecipitated from mature and activated B-cell lines, and gel-purified Syk and Lyn reassociated in vitro, demonstrating their direct interaction. This Syk-Lyn interaction may be dependent on the stage of B-cell differentiation, since Syk-Lyn associations were not detected in pre-B and myeloma cell lines and Syk from an immature B-cell line did not reassociate with Lyn in vitro. Serine/threonine kinase activity was also associated with Syk. Crosslinking of cell surface IgM led to rapid activation of both tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinase activities that resulted in phosphorylation in vitro of proteins coprecipitating with Syk--in particular, a serine/threonine phosphorylated protein 120 kDa in size (pp120). Several phosphoproteins, including one of 72 kDa and one of 120 kDa, coprecipitated with phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Sequential immunoprecipitation identified the 72-kDa protein associated with PLC gamma 1 as Syk. The 120-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated protein that coprecipitated with PLC gamma 1 resembled the Syk-associated pp120 by several criteria. Thus, pp120 may serve as a link between Syk and PLC gamma 1, coupling the B-cell antigen receptor to the phosphatidylinositol pathway.</Abstract>

																							<Abstract>The Fos and Jun families of eukaryotic transcription factors heterodimerize to form complexes capable of binding 5'-TGAGTCA-3' DNA elements. We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of a heterodimer of the bZIP regions of c-Fos and c-Jun bound to DNA. Both subunits form continuous alpha-helices. The carboxy-terminal regions form an asymmetric coiled-coil, and the amino-terminal regions make base-specific contacts with DNA in the major groove. Comparison of the two crystallographically distinct protein-DNA complexes show that the coiled-coil is flexibly joined to the basic regions and that the Fos-Jun heterodimer does not recognize the asymmetric 5'-TGAGTCA-3' recognition element in a unique orientation. There is an extensive network of electrostatic interactions between subunits within the coiled-coil, consistent with proposals that these interactions determine preferential formation of the heterodimer over either of the homodimers.</Abstract>

Roeder* TEIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TEIID are essential for activatordependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TEIID TAF, TAF1155, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAF1155 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAF,,230) of human TEIID through its central region and with multiple activators-including Spi, YY1, USE, CTF, adenoviral ElA, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins-through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFA55-interacting region of Spi was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAF,,1 10.

Psychiatry 48, 1022  The multisubunit protein complex TFIID (1-5) is required for transcription by most, if not all, promoters targeted by RNA polymerase II (class II promoters). At TATAcontaining class II promoters, TFIID first binds to the TATA box and then recruits other basal factors and RNA polymerase II to the promoter (6, 7). Whereas the TBP subunit is sufficient for basal transcription, activator-dependent transcription requires the TAFs of TFIID as well as upstream stimulatory activity (USA)-derived cofactors (5, 6, 8).

( 1-5) and by the demonstration of Drosophila TAF-specific interactions with the mammalian activators Spl and Gal4-VP16 (9, 10). The human TFIID subunit TAF1155 was isolated from a cell line that expresses epitope-tagged TBP for the immunopurification of TFIID (5). Two peptide sequences derived from thermolysin digestion of TAFII55 were used to design degenerate primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification (11). The PCR product was used as a probe to screen a human placental complementary DNA (cDNA) library.

Thus, our conclusions concern topography of the human brain while it is "idling" in a semistructured environment, which may itself influence regional brain activity. Further regional and sex differences may become evident when activity is measured during the performance of behavioral tasks or pharmacologic challenges. Nonetheless, the results suggest neural substrates for domains of human behavior related to both cognitive and emotional processing. They support a neurobiologic explanation of some sex differences in these behavioral dimensions and thus may help to explain sex-related differences in behavior. Individual differences within a sex and the overlap between the sexes may reflect "noise" in the measurement but perhaps, as can be tested empirically, can also be related to individual differences in sex-typical behavior.  19. There is evidence that such baseline measures are reproducible and can be considered to reflect a basal state [R. E. Gur et al., ibid. 44, 126 (1987); E. J. Bartlett, Psychiatry Res. Neuroimaging 40, 11 20. J. S. Karp et al., J. Nuclear Med. 31, 617 (1990). 21. About 30 million counts were collected with an unrestricted axial acceptance angle and rebinned into 45 transaxial slices, 2 mm apart. The fine spatial sampling in transaxial and axial directions minimized partial volume effects and interpolation errors [J. S. Karp, M. E. Daube-Witherspoon, G. Muehilehner, J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 11, A38 (1991)]. 22.

The ratio between high gray and low white matter metabolism is about 1.6 for the R:WB indices (about 1.8 for the raw metabolic data), consistent with earlier PET studies (24) but considerably lower than ratios reported in 2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic studies in monkeys [C.

PET does not approximate the spatial resolution of autoradiography, ROls contain mixtures of tissue types, and values are attenuated by partial volume effects and residual scatter. C. D. Spielberger, R. L. Gorsuch, R. E. Lushene, Manual for the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Consulting Psychologists Press, Palo Alto, CA, 1970). These effects could likewise not be explained by sex differences in brain volume or body mass. Metabolism did not correlate with brain volume: for the whole sample, the correlation coefficient r(59) = 0.06, for men r(35) = 0.14 and for women r(22) = 0.20; for body mass index (mass:height2), r = -0.05, -0.07, and -0.02, respectively, none of which is significant. Our sample did show a "sex-typical" pattern of performance on cognitive tests, with men outperforming women in verbal tasks and with women doing better on abstraction and verbal memory tasks. A.

Supported by NIH grants MH-43880, MH-42191, MH-48539, NS-14867, MH-00586, and MO1 RROO40.  a  TAF1I55 transcript (-2.3 kb) as detected by Northern (RNA) blotting (12) was isolated and completely sequenced. The predicted  amino acid sequence of this insert (Fig. 1) shows no extensive homology to any known genes in the GenBank database. The insert  Immunoblotting (enhanced chemiluminescence; Am55-9P11fractions ersham) was performed with polyclonal antibodies Z0000_ generated against the FLAG-tagged COOH-terminal 146 amino acids of TAF,,55 (see N204 in Fig. 3A). The antibodies (3095) recognize both TAF,,55 and any 55= FLAG-tagged proteins, such as FLAG-tagged TBP (f:TBP). Purification of bacterially expressed FLAG1 23456 tagged TAF,,55 (f:55) was performed as described (28) without the use of rifampicin.

(B) Comparison of TFIID TAFs purified from TBP- or TAF,,55-expressing cell lines. The cell lines 3-10 and 55-9 are derived from HeLa cells and constitutively express f:TBP and f:55, respectively. Purification of f:TFIID from both cell lines was as described (5). The first panel shows a silver-stained (Rapid-Ag-Stain; ICN) gel, whereas the other panels are immunoblots with various TAF antibodies. Four microliters of the f:TFIID preparations from 3-10 and 55-9 cells was loaded onto the indicated lanes. The TAF,,55 (13735) and TAF,,43 (36850) polyclonal antibodies were generated, respectively, against the six histidine-tagged N204 of TAF,,55 (Fig. 3A) and the six histidinetagged COOH-terminal 93 amino acids of TAF,,43 (12).

The sequence has been deposited in GenBank with accession number U18062.  contains a 5' untranslated region of -700 nucleotides and encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 40 kD. The predicted protein contains 40% charged residues, which may account for the abnormal electrophoretic mobility of TAF1155, and has two cysteine residues at the NH2terminus with the potential to form intraor intermolecular disulfide bonds. The cDNA corresponds to a single-copy gene that is expressed in all human tissues examined, including heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas  (12). To confirm that TAF1155 is an intrinsic TFIID subunit, we first expressed in bacteria both the synthetic FLAG epitopetagged and untagged TAF1155 proteins (13) and established a HeLa cell-derived cell line (55-9) that constitutively expresses the FLAG-tagged TAF1155 (f:55) with the use of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer (13). FLAG-tagged TFIID (f:TFIID) was purified from the phosphocellulose (P11) 0.85 M KCl fraction of 55-9 cells with M2 agaroseimmobilized FLAG antibodies and peptide elution methods (5). Both the exogenous epitope-tagged and the endogenous untagged forms of TAF1155 were detected in 55-9 cells by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies generated against the COOH-terminal 146 amino acids of TAF1155 (Fig. 2A). Most TAF1155 was present in the 0.85 M KCl fraction in which TFIID activity is found (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 to 6). The upper band (f:55) comigrates with the tagged TAF1155 in f:TFIID purified from  __M  Emniggism W,  1  I  *  55-9  cells and with bacterially expressed f:55 (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). The lower band corresponds to the untagged TAF1155 detected in HeLa cell nuclear extracts, in the HeLa cell P11 0.85 M KCI fraction, and in f:TFIID purified from a FLAG-tagged TBPexpressing cell line (3-10), as well as to bacterially expressed untagged TAF1155 (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 to 12). The protein composition of f:TFIID purified from both 55-9 and 3-10 cells was further examined by silver staining and by immunoblotting with antibodies prepared against recombinant human TAFs  A + +  Activator interaction I c  p230 interaction Helix 1 + + +  B Helix 2  a z  I c  I +  -I  Helix 3 +.+ + + +  .+- +  m  W  PKC  cAMP-K  Wi  CKII  N-lycos. 349  97.4 68.0 43.0  zz  zz zz zz 0z  M  z  c  0  r,  z   0  zz  r-z  z  N  0  z  z  r "  N  N  z  z  03Z0 0  N  OCcL ,- ~  C)  ORF  29.018.414.36.2 N38 N74  N94 N118 N139  38 74  349  349 94  349 118 139 158 167  349 349  C Ir~~~~~1 - z ---4 Z HA:230 bB. -200.0  D  ,s ,  0 0  L  N158 N167 N179 N204 N245 N279  349 349  aL  a  -a i°) z  * iO N iS O  *  ,  W -cp230b  _ CD  n  179  204 245  349 349 349  200.0 -97.4  97.4 279 349  -68.0  C324(+1  0) 1 0275  324(+10) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~275  32p-f 55 probe Fig. 3.

(B) Coomassie blue staining of f:55 deletion proteins. The FLAG-tagged proteins were purified as described (28), without the addition of rifampicin. Two microliters of each purified protein was subjected to electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was then stained with Coomassie blue.

(D) Protein blot analysis with 32P-labeled f:55 and f:TBP probes. The baculovirus-expressed f:55 and the bacterially expressed f:TBP (28) proteins were labeled in vitro with heart muscle kinase and [y-32P]ATP. Protein blotting was performed as described (30). Ten microliters of HeLa nuclear extracts (NE), P1 1 0.85 M KCl fraction (P. 85), and FLAG-purified TFIID (f:TFIID) from 3-10 cells was loaded onto each lane. SCIENCE *  VOL. 267  *  27 JANUARY 1995  533  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on November 6, 2009  The presence of defined TAFs in both preparations indicates that TAF1155 is an intrinsic TFIID subunit. The functional identity of f:TFIID purified from 55-9 cells was confirmed by transcriptional assays (14) with highly purified TFIIA, TFIIE/F/H, the cofactor fraction USA (15), RNA polymerase II, and recombinant TFIIB and Gal4-VP16. The addition of f:TFIID purified from either 3-10 or 55-9 cells supported roughly equivalent levels of both basal (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 7) and activated (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 10) transcription at comparable concentra (TAF11230,  TAF11135, TAF1195, TAF1180, TAFI155, TAF1143, and TAF1120) (Fig. 2B).  tions, demonstrating the functional equivalence of both TFIID preparations. To examine the protein-protein interactions within the TFIID complex, we expressed several NH2-terminal and COOHterminal deletion forms of TAFI155 in bacteria (16) with the FLAG-tagged protein strategy to facilitate the purification and characterization of different interaction domains (Fig. 3, A and B). Protein blot analysis with 32P-labeled baculovirus-expressed f:55 (17) as a probe revealed a direct interaction between TAF1155 and TAFI1230 (Fig. 3D, left panel), the large subunit of TFIID, which has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression ( 18, 19). Despite high backgrounds, this TAF1155TAF11230 interaction was also observed in the crude TFIID (HeLa P11, 0.85 M KCl) fraction and in HeLa nuclear extracts. Consistent with previous results (3, 18, 20), TBP showed a direct interaction with TAF11230 in similar assays (Fig. 3D, right panel). Solution interactions between TAF1155 and TAF11230 were also monitored by immunoblotting [with TAF11230 and hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies] after incubation of an insect cell lysate containing  recombinant HA-tagged human TAF11230 with various immobilized f:55 deletion proteins (21) (Fig. 3C). The TAF11230-interacting domain was mapped to the central region of TAF1155 between amino acids 139 and 249 (Fig. 3, A and C). Because TAF1155 is a highly charged protein that may potentially interact with various molecules, we explored the interactions of activators with TAF1155. Interactions between affinity-purified transcription factors (22) (Fig. 4A, top panel) and TAF1155 were monitored first by protein blot analysis with the 32P-labeled baculovirus-expressed f:55 as a probe (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). Signals were detected in lanes that contained USF, Spl, YY1, human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV1) Tat, Gal4-E1A, and Gal4-Pro (the underloaded USF and Gal4-Pro signals are more evident in longer exposures; see also Fig. 4B), indicating a direct interaction between TAF1155 and these activators; in contrast, no signal was apparent, even after longer exposure, in lanes containing equivalent amounts of HPV-1 1 E2, the nuclear factor KB (NF-KB) p50 subunit, LBPlc, Gal4-VP16, and the overloaded protein size  --- -  - . . 1. -.ilillisilillillilll. markers  (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). The difference in signal intensity among various activators may have been attributable to variations in amounts loaded, renaturation efficiencies, or intrinsic binding affinities for TAF1155. The use of TFIIB as a probe for protein blot analysis with the same activators showed strong signals detected in lanes containing Spl, YY1, and Gal4-VP16 (12), indicating a direct interaction between TFIIB and these activators (23). The observation that Gal4-E1A and Gal4-VP16 share the same DNA-binding domain but interact, respectively, with TAF1155 and TFIIB A L  suggests that different activation domains may have preferential targets in the general transcriptional machinery in order to activate transcription. Interaction between TAF1155 and Gal4-Pro also implies that TAF1155 may associate directly with natural CTF proteins. To confirm these results for natural cellular activators, we incubated nuclear extracts with several immobilized f:55 deletion proteins and monitored bound proteins by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. This experiment confirmed interactions between TAF1155 and USF, Spl, YY1, and CTF (Fig. 4B, lanes ORF and ReferB LL 0  . U) "~  I CCL 2 s.

(B) The NH2-terminal domain of TAF1155 interacts with various activators. HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated, separately, with five different immobilized f:55 deletion proteins. The bound proteins subsequently eluted from the columns were detected by immunoblotting with specific activator antibodies. The Sp1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz. The input HeLa nuclear extracts (NE) and purified activators (22) (Reference) were also loaded, individually, as positive controls for each panel. (C) The NH2-terminal region of TAF,,55 between amino acids 38 and 1 13 is essential for interaction with various activators. Solution interaction studies were performed with various immobilized f:55 deletion proteins and HeLa nuclear extracts as described in (B). (D) TAF1155 interacts with the DNA-binding domain of Spi. The cytosolic fractions of HeLa cells infected by vaccinia viruses that overexpress various Sp1 proteins-including the full-length protein (FL), the NH2-terminal 539 residues that contain both the glutamine-rich activation domains A and B (N539), activation domain B linked to the COOH-terminal 168 residues (440CAintl 12), and the COOH-terminal 168 residues containing the DNA-binding domain and the activation domain D (168C) (32)-were incubated, separately, with columns of immobilized full-length TAF1,55 that was prepared with the use of the FLAG tag. Bound proteins were then eluted and detected by immunoblotting with Spi antibodies. Molecular sizes (in kilodaltons) of the prestained protein markers are indicated on the left.

These interactions were eliminated by NH2-terminal deletions that extend to residue 117, but persisted (and in the case of YY1 were slightly enhanced) with COOHterminal deletions that extend to position 114 (Fig. 4B, compare lanes ORF, N118, and Cl 13). A more detailed mapping of the TAF1155 interaction domain suggested that the NH2-terminal region of TAF155 between amino acids 38 and 113 is essential for activator interactions (Fig. 4C). As inferred from protein blot analysis, no interaction of TAF155 with the NF-KB p50 subunit (Fig. 4B) or LBPlc (12) was observed in solution interaction studies, indicating the specificity in these assays. The importance of the NH2terminal region of TAF1155 in mediating interactions with HIV-1 Tat was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid analysis (12). To further investigate TAFI155-activator interactions, we mapped the TAF1155-interacting domain of Spl. The cytosolic fractions of HeLa cells infected by vaccinia viruses overexpressing either the full-length or various mutated Spl proteins were incubated, separately, with immobilizedTAF1155 columns. Bound proteins were then eluted and detected by immunoblotting with Spl antibodies. All proteins that contained the COOH-terminal 168 amino acids of Spl interacted with TAF1155 (Fig. 4D, lanes 5, 7, and 8). In contrast, an Spl derivative that contained only the glutamine-rich activation domains without the DNA-binding domain showed no interaction with TAF1155 (Fig. 4D, lane 6), even after longer exposure. This result is consistent with protein blot analysis, which failed to show any direct interaction between TAF1155 and a fusion protein (Gal4-Gln) that contained only the glutamine-rich domains of Spl fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (12). This TAF1155 targeting through the DNA-binding domain of Spl is distinct from that of Drosophila TAF11110, which interacts strongly with the glutamine-rich activation domains of Spl (9). The DNA-binding domain of Spl has previously been shown to interact with YY1 (24) and with adenoviral E1A protein (25). Other examples of regulatory protein interactions with the DNA-binding domains of transcription factors include interactions of VP16 with OctI, TBP with c-Rel, and E1A with various activators (25, 26). Attempts to assemble TFIID in vivo by the establishment of cell lines expressing various epitope-tagged TAFII55 deletion proteins were not successful ( 12), possibly because of the inability of mutated TAF1155 to compete with the wild-type endogenous TAF1155 for assembly into TFIID complexes. Nevertheless, in corresponding cell lines, TAF1155 mutants with short NH2terminal deletions, such as N74 and N94 (Fig. 3A), still bind TAF11230, whereas  ~!lllli~bmi  .-111E10,110  11 1 1 1 l! . .1'1 1 1 . 1 C)TCIGCIATIAT(T/C)TC ICCICGIGTGGAIACIGCITCIGCATCIGT-3', for PCR amplification of singlestranded cDNA that was derived from polyadenylated RNA of human cervical carcinoma C-33A cells by reverse transcription-PCR [C.-M. Chiang, L. T. Chow, T. R. Broker, Methods Mol. Biol. 15, 189 (1993)]. The PCR product was then used to screen a human placental cDNA library [M. Hirata et al., Nature 349, 617 (1991)]. Seven positive clones were isolated from 106 phage plaques; three have G, whereas the other four have T, at nucleotide 1224. The second peptide sequence obtained has a serine residue at this particular position. C.-M. Chiang and R. G. Roeder, unpublished data. The bacterial expression plasmids pF:55-1 1 d and p55-11 a express the FLAG-tagged and untagged TAF1155, respectively. An Nde site was first created by PCR at the initiation codon of the TAF1,55 cDNA, which was rescued in pBS-SK(-) from the 7-21 lambda Zapil phage isolate (Stratagene). The fragment between this Nde site and a Bam HI site (located at the downstream linker sequence) of TAFA15 cDNA (containing nucleotides 691 to 2274) was then cloned into pF:TBPA11 d (28), after removal of the TBP insert by Nde and Bam HI digestion, to create pF:55-1 1d. In a similar manner, the TAF,,55 open reading frame was isolated from pF:55-1 1 d at the Nde and Bam HI sites (created at the termination codon of TAFA15) and cloned into pET-1 1 a (Novagen) to create p55-11 a. The plasmid pBn-F:55 was constructed by cloning the TAF1155 cDNA from pF:55-1 1d after Bam HI and partial Bgl II digestion into the Bam HI site of pBabe neo [J. P. Morgenstern and H. Lund, Nucleic Acids Res. 18, 3587 (1990)]; it was used to establish 55-9 cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer as described (5). Purification of TFIIA, TFIIE/F/H, and USA from 3-10 nuclear extracts was as described for HeLa cells (5). Purification of RNA polymerase 11 from 3-10 nuclear pellets, recombinant Gal4-VP1 6, and FLAG-tagged TFIIB was according to the published procedures (28, 29) [D. Reinberg and R. G. Roeder, J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3310 (1987)]. Transcriptional assays were performed as described (5). M. Meisterernst, A. L. Roy, H. M. Lieu, R. G. Roeder, Cell 66, 981 (1991). All of the f:55 deletion plasmids, except C324(+ 10) and C113, were constructed by introducing either Nde or Bam HI sites by PCR at the NH2-terminusor COOH-terminus-encoding sequences of deletion clones. The Nde and Bam HI fragments of different deletion clones were then swapped with the fulllength TAF55 clone pF:55(ORF)-1 1 d, which has Nde and Bam HI sites created respectively at the initiation and termination codons of the wild-type 691 to 1740).

Sf9 insect cells were harvested 48 hours after infection with recombinant baculoviruses carrying the human HA:230 gene. Cell pellets were resuspended in bacterial lysis buffer (28) containing 0.1 % NP-40, sonicated to break cells, and centrifuged. The supernatant was then incubated with different f:55 deletion proteins immobilized in M2 agarose (1B1/Kodak). The bound proteins were recovered after elution with the synthetic FLAG peptide (28) and used for immunoblot analysis. 22. Spi was purified from HeLa cells by wheat germ agglutinin and oligonucleotide columns as previously described [S. P. Jackson and R. TJian, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86,1781 (1989)].

For purification of FLAG-tagged Gal4 fusion proteins, bacterial cultures containing individual plasmids were induced and harvested as previously described for regular FLAG-tagged proteins (28). Bacterial pellets from 1 -liter cultures were resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (29) containing 0.4 M NaCI and 0.1% NP-40, and sonicated to break cells. A portion (10 ml) of the sonication supematant was incubated overnight with 200 pl. of M2 agarose. The M2 agarose with bound proteins was washed four times in buffer A containing 0.4 M NaCI and four times in BC100/Zn buffer [20 mM tris-Cl (pH 7.9 at 4°C), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 p.M zinc acetate, 100 mM KCI, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM dithiothreitol], and finally transferred to a microcentrifuge spin column (Invitrogen). The bound proteins were then eluted from the M2 agarose by incubation with 400 p1 of BC100/Zn containing 0.2 mg of the FLAG peptide at 40C for 1 hour. Purification of the other FLAG-tagged proteins was as described (28), without the addition of rifampicin. 23. Y.-S. Lin and M. R. Green, Cell 64, 971 (1991); A. Usheva and T.

We constructed the baculoviral expression plasmid pVL-F:55 by cloning the Bam HI-Xba fragment of pGEM7-F:55 into pVL1 393 (Invitrogen) at the same enzyme cutting sites. We created the plasmid pGEM7-F:55 by inserting the Nde l-Xba fragment of pF:55-1 1 d (spanning nucleotides 691 to 2045) into pFLAG(AS)-7 (5) after Nde and Xba digestion. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing f:55 were generated by cotransfecting 1 pLg of pVL-F:55 and 0.25 pgg of BaculoGold linearized baculoviral DNA (PharMingen) into Sf9 insect cells with 10 A.l of cationic liposome (Invitrogen) and 0.5 ml of TC-100 (Gibco). The baculovirus-expressed f:55 was purified from the Sf9 cell pellets 48 hours after viral infection with the same procedures used for purification of the bacterially expressed f:55 (Fig. 2). Two hundred nanograms of purified f:55 and f:TBP were labeled with 32P at the heart muscle kinase phosphorylation site present in the FLAG-tagged sequence (28, 30) by incubation with heart muscle kinase and [y-32P]ATP (adenosine triphosphate) for 30 min at 30no. Labeled proteins were then separated from the unincorporated free nucleotide with the Nick column (Pharmacia) and used as probes for protein blot analysis as described (30).  (1991). 3. R.

These results further strengthen the conclusion of the TAF1155 and TAF11230 interaction studies based on in vitro solution interaction assays (Fig. 3C). Previous studies have shown interactions of Drosophila TAF111 10 and Drosophila TAF1140 with the glutamine-rich activation domains of human SpI and the acidic activation domain of Gal4-VP16, respectively, which suggests that individual TAFs may serve as targets for different types of activation domains (9, 10). We have shown here that a single human TFIID TAF (TAF1155) with no apparent Drosophila homolog is capable of interacting with a variety of mammalian activators whose activation domains and DNA-binding domains are thought to differ in overall character but could share subtle commonality of structure (27). In the case of SpI (Fig. 4D) and USF (12), it appears that targeting to the DNA-binding domain of activators by a TFIID TAF may be another way to modulate transcriptional activities. Given the restricted number of TAFs in TFIID, and assuming that they help mediate activation by the hundreds of activators so far identified, it seems reasonable, on the basis of our results, that a single TAF may serve as a target for multiple transcriptional activators. The observation that some activators can interact with multiple components (basal factors, TAFs, or USA-derived cofactors) in the transcriptional machinery is consistent either with concerted (possibly synergistic) interactions of multiply bound activators (or distinct domains in a single activator) or with sequential or alternative interactions of a single activator on a given promoter (8).

Peltier (1) presents a model that the paleotopography of glacial were  not  sheets on the basis of sea level and the viscoelastic properties of the earth's crust and mantle. The model has profound implications because it suggests that the elevation of northern hemisphere glacial-age ice sheets was much lower than previously believed. The low topography has implications for atmospheric general circulation models of ice age climate. Furthermore, the model suggests that the glacial-age Antarctic Ice Sheet was significantly larger than today's. Such models can now be tested more rigorously because of the advent of sea level curves that have high resolution and cover most of deglaciation. Before the late 1980s, most deglacial records covered only the very last portion of deglaciation and chronologies were established with 14C dating. In the late 1980s the development of thermal ionization mass spectrometric (TIMS) techniques for measuring 234U (2) and 230Th (3) provided the capability to obtain high-precision 230Th ages of coral skeletons (3). TIMS 230Th dates have advantages over 14C dates because they (i) have higher precision and (ii) do not require independent calibration. The advent of TIMS 230Th dating provided impetus for researchers to drill for deglacial sequences of corals, with the goal of obtaining long, high-resolution records of deglaciation. Two sequences that cover most of deglaciation have been drilled and analyzed: the Barbados sequence (4), which covers the complete deglaciation, and the Papua New Guinea sequence (5, 6), which covers the last half of deglaciation. Peltier (1 ) used the Barbados sea level record to tune his model and tested model output against the Papua New Guinea record. Model output matched the Papua New Guinea record well, apparently supporting the model's validity. However, Peltier (1) used depths for the 536  Papua New Guinea and Barbados data that corrected for tectonic uplift. The Barbados uplift rate is small, 0.34 m per thousand years (4), amounting to a correction of 7 m for the deepest portion of the core. Thus, the Barbados correction can be excluded without serious consequence. The model results disagree only slightly with the corrected Barbados record (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the uplift rate at the Papua New Guinea site is much larger. The rate of 1.9 m per thousand years is well known and documented (5-7), and amounts to a correction of more than 20 m for the oldest portion of the record (5, 6). Model results disagree with the corrected Papua New Guinea record (Fig. 1). Because the Barbados curve was used for tuning, the Papua New Guinea record is the only long independent sea level curve upon which to test model results. The inability of the model to  REFERENCES 1.

SCIENCE *  Response: I am grateful for having attention drawn to one of the secondary aspects of the work described in my article (1). My purpose was to advance a methodology whereby the continental ice sheets that existed at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) might be "weighed," even in absentia. The limited application of this methodology (1) was based on several assumptions, mainly that (i) the ice sheets could be safely assumed to be in isostatic equilibrium at LGM, (ii) the viscosity of the planetary mantle was approximately a function of radius only, and (iii) the records of relative sea level history based on coral sequences from Barbados and the Huon Peninsula of Papua New Guinea could be analyzed without making the usual correction for a presumed constant local rate of tectonic uplift. Edwards questions the reasonableness of (iii), given the extent to which the 0.34 mm year- and 1.9 mm  VOL. 267  *  27 JANUARY 1995  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on November 6, 2009  reproduce the Papua New Guinea curve would appear to cast doubt on other model results, including those related to the paleotopography of the glacial ice sheets. Thus, resolution of the discrepancy between the Papua New Guinea data and the modeling results is a central issue. R.

																								<Abstract>In neurons cAMP-dependent protein kinase II beta (PKAII beta) is sequestered in the dendritic cytoskeleton because the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of the enzyme is tightly bound by A Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). The prototypic neuronal anchor protein AKAP75 has a COOH-terminal 22-residue RII beta binding (tethering) site. A key feature of the tethering site is that several amino acids with large aliphatic side chains mediate the high-affinity binding of RII beta. Mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, and physicochemical characterization were used to investigate the structural basis for the homodimerization and AKAP75 binding activities of RII beta. Several crucial residues are located in an NH2-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 13-36. Substitution of Ala for Leu13 or Phe36 generates monomeric RII beta subunits that cannot bind AKAP75. The results are not due to general misfolding since mutant RII beta monomers bind cAMP and inhibit the catalytic subunit of PKAII beta with the same affinity and efficacy as wild-type RII beta dimers. Moreover, substitution of Ala for Leu12, Val20, Leu21, Phe31, Leu33, or Leu39 and replacement of Leu13 with Ile or Val did not impair the dimerization reaction. Evidently, large hydrophobic side chains of Leu13 and Phe36 play pivotal roles in stabilizing RII beta-RII beta interactions. A secondary consequence of destabilizing RII beta dimers is the loss of intracellular targeting/anchoring capacity because monomers fail to bind AKAP75. Other NH2-terminal residues directly modulate the affinity of RII beta dimers for the AKAP75 tethering site. Replacement of Val20-Leu21 with Ala-Ala produced a dimeric RII beta protein that binds AKAP75 approximately 4% as avidly as wild-type RII beta. It is possible that the aliphatic side chains of Val20 and Leu21 interact with the essential Leu and Ile residues in the AKAP75 tethering region.</Abstract>

D B Bregman , N Bhattacharyya and C S Rubin Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Atran Laboratories, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461. Abstract Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase II-B appears to be adapted for function in the mammalian central nervous system via the properties of its regulatory subunit (RII-B). RII-B is selectively expressed in the central nervous system, tightly associated with cerebral cortex membranes, and avidly complexed by the bovine brain calmodulin-binding protein designated P75 (Sarkar, D., Erlichman, J., and Rubin, C. S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 9840-9846). Complexes of RII-B and P75 polypeptides can be purified to near homogeneity from either membrane or cytosolic fractions of brain homogenates, suggesting that the binding protein plays a role in determining the central nervous system-specific properties of protein kinase II-B. To investigate the properties of a prototypic, nonabundant, RII-B-binding protein, we have cloned and characterized cDNAs for rat brain P150, a homolog of bovine brain P75. cDNAs were retrieved from a lambda gt11 expression library using 32P-labeled RII-B as a functional probe. cDNA inserts (800 and 1100 base pairs) subcloned into expression plasmids directed the production of partial P150 polypeptides in Escherichia coli that bind RII-B. Sequence analyses disclosed that P150 is a previously uncharacterized protein that contains multiple octapeptide repeats as well as unique sequences. Antibodies directed against 15-residue peptides corresponding to either repeated or unique sequences bound the polypeptides expressed in E. coli and a 150-kDa protein in rat brain membranes and cytosol. Moreover, the immunoprecipitated 150-kDa protein exhibited high affinity RII-B-binding activity. Finally, 3' deletion analysis demonstrated that a 15-amino acid segment of P150 is essential for binding with RII-B. CiteULike Complore Connotea Del.icio.us Digg What's this?

																								<Abstract>Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-1. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag-1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1.</Abstract>

<BodyText>Cell, Vol. 80, 279-284, January 27, 1995, Copyright © 1995 by Cell Press  Cloning and Functional Analysis of BAG-l: A Novel Bcl-2-Binding Protein with Anti-Cell Death Activity Shinichi Takayama, Takaaki Sato, Stanislaw Krajewski, Kristine Kochel, Shinji Irie, Juan A. Millan, and John C. Reed The La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation La Jolla, California 92037 protein. Gene transfer-mediated elevations in the levels of this Bcl-2-binding protein can prolong cell survival in some circumstances and also can cooperate with Bcl-2 in the suppression of apoptosis. These properties suggest that the gene encoding this protein represents a novel type of anti-cell death gene, which we have termed BAG-l, for Bcl-2-associated athanogene 1 (from the Greek word athanos, which refers to anti-death).  Summary Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we identified cDNAs that encode a novel Bcl-2-binding protein, termed BAG-l. The BAG-1 protein shares no significant homology with Bci-2 or other Bcl-2 family proteins, which can form homo- and heterodimers. In gene transfer experiments using a human lymphoid cell line, Jurkat, coexpression of BAG-1 and Bcl-2 provided markedly increased protection from cell death induced by several stimuli, including staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, relative to cells that contained gene transfer-mediated elevations in either BAG-1 or Bcl-2 protein alone. BAG-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts also exhibited prolonged cell survival in response to an apoptotic stimulus. The findings indicate that bag.1 represents a new type of anti-cell death gene and suggest that some routes of apoptosis induction previously ascribed to Bcl-2-independent pathways may instead reflect a need for the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-l. Introduction Cell death plays an important role in a wide variety of physiological circumstances in essentially all complex multicellular organisms (reviewed by Ellis et al., 1991). Several genes have been identified that participate as either inducers or repressors of programmed cell death. Among these is bcl-2 (for B cell lymphoma 2), a blocker of cell death that was first discovered by virtue of its involvement in the t(14;18) chromosomal translocations found in the majority of non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphomas (Tsujimoto and Croce, 1986). Gene transfer-mediated elevations in Bcl-2 protein levels have been shown to render cells relatively more resistant to induction of apoptosis by a.n impressive variety of stimuli and insults, suggesting that this protein regulates a distal step in a final common pathway for apoptotic cell death (reviewed by Reed, 1994). Furthermore, elements of this pathway appear to be well conserved throughout evolution (Vaux et al., 1992b; Hengartner and Horvitz, 1994). The biochemical mechanism of action of the Bcl-2 protein remains enigmatic, principally because its predicted amino acid sequence shares no significant homology with other proteins whose functions are known. For this reason, we have attempted to identify proteins that can bind to Bcl-2. Here we describe the molecular cloning and functional characterization of cDNAs encoding a novel protein that interacts physically and functionally with the Bcl-2  Results Molecular Cloning of cDNAs for BAG-1 To identify cDNAs encoding proteins that can bind to Bcl-2, a mouse embryo cDNA library in a X phage expression vector was screened with recombinant human Bcl-2 protein. Phage clones that produced proteins capable of binding to recombinant Bcl-2 protein were then detected by incubation of filters with a human-specific anti-Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody, resulting in a single positive clone from a screen of - 106 phage clones. DNA sequencing revealed an 830 bp insert, containing a 630 bp coding region inframe with the upstream T7/10 protein sequences derived from the XEX-lox cloning vector. BAG-1 Protein Specifically Interacts with Bcl-2 In Vitro An immobilized protein interaction (Far Western blot) assay was performed to confirm the ability of recombinant Bcl-2 protein to bind to BAG-1 protein. The bag-1 partial cDNA described above was subcloned into the plasmid pGEX-3X and expressed in Escherichia coil as a GSTBAG-1 fusion protein. GST-BAG-1 and GST nonfusion protein were compared with regards to binding of baculovirus-produced Bcl-2, using the same filter binding assay employed for library screening. As shown in Figure 1A, Bcl-2 bound to GST-BAG-1 but not to GST protein. In this experiment, cell lysates from a murine lymphoid cell, $49.1, that had been stably infected with a recombinant retrovirus encoding human Bcl-2 protein (S49.1-BCL-2) or a control retrovirus ($49.1-NEO) (Miyashita and Reed, 1992) were also included. The prominent - 2 6 kDa band seen in S49-BCL-2 cell lysates represents direct binding of the anti-human Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody 4D7 to human Bcl-2 protein in the S49.1-BCL-2 cells, thus serving as a control for the antibody detection system. In addition, however, a faint band at - 2 8 - 3 0 kDa was also seen in both S49.1-BCL-2 and $49.1-NEO cells that may represent binding of recombinant Bcl-2 protein to endogenous BAG-1 protein (see below). As a control, Far Western blot analysis was performed using Sf9 lysates derived from cells infected with a 13-galactosidase (13-gal)-expressing baculovirus (Figure 1A, right). To determine whether the interaction of BAG-1 with Bcl-2 can also take place in solution, soluble GST-BAG-1 and GST control proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and then incubated with lysates prepared from Sf9 cells that had been infected with either Bcl-2 Cell  280  A  ~ ~ o ~ . ¢~  ~ o .s~  MAKTEEMVQT LLVTPQQGNS FQF~LIFKGKS LIGEKSNPEE  EEMETPRLSV EPWQDLAQL LKEMETPLSA Eg-ELKKLKDL  IVTHSNERYD VEEATGVPLP LGMQNGCRVM EVSAEKIANH  30 60 90 120 150 180 210 219  LQELNKELSG IQQGFLAKEL QAEALCKLDR KVKATIEQFM KILEEIDTMV LPEQFKDSRL KRKNLVKKVQ VFLAECDTVE QYICQETERL QSTNLALAE  ,i BCL-2 ~ - . !.-~. ili  -  33 - 28 -19  Figure 2.

A region in the mouse BAG-1 protein (residues 37-73) shows as much as 50% amino acid sequence identity (66% similarity) with several ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins. The region from amino acid - 100 to amino acid - 212 is predicted to assume a largely m-helical conformation and contains segments that on Edmundson wheel plots are predicted to be amphipathic in nature and thus good candidates for participation in coiled-coil interactions with other proteins. Kyte-Doolittle plots failed to reveal any hydrophobic domains in BAG-1 that would suggest the presence of a transmembrane domain or hydrophobic leader sequence.

After the beads were washed, associated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using a Bcl-2-specific antibody (Reed et al., 1991). As shown, Bcl-2 protein was specifically recovered from Sf9 cell lysates on GST-BAG-1 Sepharose but not on beads that contained GST control protein (Figure 1B). Though the data are not presented here, Bcl-2 also did not associate with several other control GST fusion proteins. The interaction of BAG-1 with Bcl-2 was also confirmed by a yeast two-hybrid method (data not shown). Predicted Amino Acid Sequence of BAG-1 Reveals a Novel Protein  Using the partial bag-1 cDNA as a hybridization probe for cDNA library screening, we obtained additional bag-I cDNAs, thus deducing the complete open reading frame for the 219 amino acid mouse BAG-1 protein (Figure 2). BAG-1 is novel and shares no similarity with Bcl-2 or its homologous proteins. The BAG-1 protein is acidic (predicted pl, 4.81) and contains multiple glutamic acid residues (31 of 219). Although this raised the possibility of Ca 2÷ binding, no clear homology was observed with other  A cDNA encoding full-length BAG-1 protein was subcloned into a mammalian expression plasmid, pCEP-4, that contains a hygromycin phosphotransferase gene and was introduced into Jurkat T cell lines that had previously been stably transfected with either a bcl-2 (pZip-Bcl-2) or a control (pZip-NEO) expression plasmid (Torigoe et al., 1994a, 1994b). After selection in hygromycin, the BAG-1 transfectant cells were analyzed by immunoblotting using BAG-Iand Bcl-2-specific anti-peptide antisera. Elevated levels of BAG-1 protein were detected in the Jurkat-Bcl-2 and Jurkat-NEO transfectants that received the p C E P - 4 BAG-1 ptasmid but not those that were transfected with pCEP-4 parental control plasmid (Figure 3, left). Despite a predicted molecular mass of - 24.5 kDa, note that the BAG-1 protein migrates as a - 2 9 - 3 0 kDa protein, presumably owing to its acidic nature. As expected, Bcl-2 protein levels were markedly elevated in the Jurkat-Bcl-2 cells as compared with Jurkat-NEO cells (Figure 3, right). We next explored the relative sensitivity of these doubly transfected T cells to induction of apoptosis by several stimuli. As shown in Figure 4, Jurkat T cells with gene transfer-mediated elevations in Bcl-2 protein were partially resistant to cytotoxicity induced by 1 p~g/ml anti-Fas antibody. In contrast with Bcl-2, gene transfer-mediated elevations in BAG-1 by themselves had essentially no effect on the relative sensitivity of Jurkat T cells to anti-Fasinduced cytotoxicity. In combination with Bcl-2, however, elevations in BAG-1 protein levels resulted in markedly enhanced resistance to anti-Fas-induced apoptosis. Similar conclusions were reached on the basis of experiments where the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine was employed to induce apoptosis in Jurkat T cells.

The arrows indicate the positions of the BAG-1 and Bcl-2 proteins. Control-transfected Jurkat cells (C) contained the pZip-NEO and pCEP-4 plasmids without inserted bcl-2 or bag-1 cDNAs.  Figure 4, BAG-1 alone provided only slightly enhanced protection from staurosporine-induced cell death. Bcl-2 was partially protective, with less than half of the cells still alive after 2 days.

The d;fferential survival of these Jurkat T cell transfectants was not attributable to variations in rates of spontaneous cell death, since cell viability was &amp;gt;95% for all four cell lines when cultured for up to 3 or 4 days without anti-Fas antibody or other stimuli. Comparable results were obtained when several independent clones of tranfected J u rkat cells were evaluated (data not shown). Next, Jurkat cells were labeled with 51Cr and then cocultured with cloned cytolytic T cells. Specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-induced slCr release was then monitored in standard 4 hr cytotoxicity assays. These cloned T cells were previously shown to exhibit lymphokineactivated killer (LAK)-Iike cytolytic activity against Jurkat and certain other tumor cell lines through a CD3- and major histocompatibility complex-independent mechanism (Torigoe et al., 1994a, 1994b). Some of these cytolytic T cells had been stably transfected with expression plasmids encoding normal Lck kinase (N-Lck) or a constitutively active mutant version of Lck (A-Lck), since our previous investigations demonstrated that elevated levels of Lck kinase activity can enhance cytolytic T cell killing by increasing secretion of cytotoxic granules and expression of cell adhesion proteins (Torigoe et al., 1994a). Jurkat cells with elevations in BAG-1 protein exhibited some slight but reproducible (n = 3) resistance to lysis induced by CTLs. Jurkat cells with elevated levels of Bcl-2 protein were relatively more resistant than the BAG-1 transfectants, but not as resistant as Jurkat cells that contained gene transfermediated elevations in both Bcl-2 and BAG-1 proteins. Depending on the particular CTL clone examined, Jurkat cells overexpressing the combination of Bcl-2 and BAG-1 experienced only 16%-23% as much lysis as controltransfected Jurkat cells, compared with 76%-79% for the BAG-1 single transfectants and 40o--50% for the Bcl-2 single transfectants. Taken together, these data indicate that BAG-1 can augment the anti-cell death function of Bcl-2. Analysis of BAG-1 Function in 3T3 Fibroblasts  0'  12  2'4 " 4 ~ TIME(hrs)  50]  I  ~  T C T L .

BAG-1 Cooperates with Bcl-2 to Increase Resistance to Cell Death in Jurkat T Cells Transfected Jurkat cells were cultured at 5 x 105 cells/ml in complete medium containing either 1 ~g/ml of anti-Fas monoclonal antibody 2D1 (top) or 10 p.M staurosporine (middle). The percentage viable cells were then determined at various times thereafter by trypan blue dye exclusion. Equivalent data were obtained using MTT assays (data not shown). Jurkat cells were labeled with SlCr (bottom) and mixed with CTLL-2 cytolytic T cells that had been transfected with expression plasmids, producing constitutively activated Lck kinase (Tyr~ Phe505), normal Lck kinase, or neo control plasmid alone. Specific Cr release was measured 4 hr later. All data represent mean -- standard deviation (n = 3).  In contrast with Jurkat T cells where BAG-1 alone only marginally enhanced cell survival, gene transfer studies using BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts suggested that BAG-1 can have significant anti-cell death activity in some cells even when transfected without Bcl-2 expression plasmids. In these experiments, 3T3 cells were stably transfected either with the BAG-1 expression plasmid pRc/CMV-BAG-1 or with the pRc-CMV plasmid lacking an inserted bag-1 cDNA. For comparison, 3T3 cells were also transfected with a Bcl-2 expression plasmid. Initially, a polyclonal line of G418-resistant BAG-1 transfectants was obtained but found to contain BAG-1 protein at levels not detectably above those seen in control-transfected 3T3 cells (lanes 1 and 2 of Figure 5). Individual clones from this bulktransfected line were therefore obtained and some identified that had elevations in BAG-1 protein, presumably reflecting integration of the plasmid DNA into sites favorable for expression. The clone shown in Figure 5 (lane 3; clone number 19), for instance, contained -3-fold higher levels of BAG-1 than the NEO control transfectants (lane 2). In  Ceil 282  ] ~BAG-1 ~ 1 .

In somecases, independentcloneswere isolatedfrom the pRc/ CMV-BAG-l-transfected line: clones number 19 (lane 3) and number 28 (lane 4). Immunoblot analysis was performed (30 p.g of cellular proteins) using antibodiesspecific for either the BAG-1 (lanes 1-4) or human Bcl-2(lanes5-7) proteinsand usingan ECL method.The t(14; 18)-containingline RS11846was included as a positive control (lane 7) for Bcl-2. The blot (lanes 1-4) was subsequentlyincubatedwith an antiserumspecificfor FI-~,-ATPase(detected by a colorimetricassay) to verify loading of equal amounts of protein. At top, 3T3 transfectantswere cultured at 104cells/well(50%-70% confluent)for various times with 1 p.M staurosporine,and the relative number of viable cells was determined by MIF assay and expressed as a control relativeto untreatedcells at the initiationof the experiment (mean _ standard deviation; n = 3).  many other G418-resistant clones, however, the levels of BAG-1 protein were essentially unchanged from baseline (clone number 28, for example; lane 4 of Figure 5). Previously we showed that the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine is a potent inducer of apoptosis in fibroblast cell lines (Jacobson et al., 1993), often producing more synchronous and reproducible cell death kinetics than serum withdrawal. We therefore challenged BAG-1 and control-transfected 3T3 cells with 1 p.M staurosporine and monitored cell survival at various times thereafter. As shown, for example, by the results obtained with the BAG-1overexpressing clone 19, gene transfer-mediated elevations in BAG-1 protein prolonged the survival of BALB/c 3T3 cells relative to other clones, such as clone 28, which had been transfected with the same bag-1 cDNA-containing plasmid but failed to produce higher levels of BAG-1 protein (Figure 5). This prolongation of cell survival was typically similar to that seen for 3T3 cells that had been stably transfected with a Bcl-2-encoding expression plasmid. Discussion  Using a protein interaction cloning technique, we have identified cDNAs encoding a novel Bcl-2-binding protein. With the exception of a ubiquitin-like domain, the predicted  amino acid sequence of BAG-1 has no clear similarity to other known proteins and contains no motifs that would indicate a biochemical function for this protein. BAG-1 therefore may represent the prototype of a novel type of anti-cell death gene. Although Bcl-2 has been shown to bind to several homologous proteins, including Bax (for Bcl-2-associated x protein), Bcl-x,, Bcl-xs, and Mcll (Sato et al., 1994; Oltvai et al., 1993), BAG-1 lacks sequence homology with Bcl-2 and its related proteins. All Bcl-2 homologs identified thus far contain significant amino acid similarity in at least one of three well-conserved domains, which we have previously designated Bcl-2 domains A, B, and C (Sato et al., 1994). The BAG-1 protein lacks similarity to all three of these conserved domains, indicating that it is not a member of the Bcl-2 protein family. BAG-1 contains a domain located at residues 37-73 that has sequence similarity with several ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, including the human and mouse Gdx-1 protein (50%, 43s/o), baculovirus ubiquitin-like protein (46%), and the mouse Nedd8 gene (36%). Ubiquitin is a small 76 amino acid protein that is well conserved throughout evolution and that becomes covalently attached to pro* teins, typically as part of a nonlysosomal, ATP-dependent protein degradation pathway (reviewed by Hershko and Ciechanover, 1992; Rechsteiner, 1991). Ubiquitins contain a conserved lysine at position 48 that provides an amino acceptor group for covalent ligation to the carboxyl group of the C-terminal glycine of other ubiquitin molecules during the formation of branch chain ubiquitinubiquitin conjugates on target proteins. Interestingly, a lysine is found at position 67 within the ubiquitin-like domain of BAG-1 that corresponds to lysine 48 of ubiquitin. Internal lysines have also been shown to be the sites of ubiquitin conjugation in some other proteins that become polyubiquitinated and thereby targeted for degradation. Thus, one possible role of the ubiquitin-like domain in BAG-1 may be to serve as a site for attachment of ubiquitin and subsequent proteolytic degradation. In this regard, ubiquitin conjugation has been shown to regulate the turnover of other proteins that are either known or thought to play a role in cell death regulation in mammals, including the tumor suppressor p53 and some cyclins (Rechsteiner, 1991 ; Hershco and Ciechanover, 1992). In addition, previous studies using antisense approaches have documented a requirement for ubiquitin for apoptosis induced by "y-radiation in thymocytes (Delic et al., 1993). Inasmuch as this ubiquitin-like domain may be involved in targeting BAG-1 for degradation, it may be relevant that Jurkat cells cotransfected with Bcl-2 and BAG-1 consistently contained higher relative levels of BAG-1 protein than cells transfected with BAG-1 alone, suggesting that the interaction of BAG-1 with Bcl-2 potentially could stabilize the BAG-1 protein (Figure 3; data not shown). Unlike the protein ubiquitin, the function of the ubiquitin-like domains found in Gdx-1, Nedd-8, and other ubiquitin-like proteins is unknown. It has been speculated, however, that they may mediate protein-protein recognition (Toniolo et al., 1988), and thus, the ubiquitin-like domain in BAG-1 theoretically may participate in the binding of BAG-1 to Bcl-2 or other proteins. Recent studies indicate that proteases  BAG-l, a Novel Anti-Cell Death Gene 283  can be essential for induction of programmed cell death and apoptosis in a variety of physiological and pathological circumstances (Yuan et al., 1993; Miura et al., 1993; Sarin et al., 1994; Gagliardini et al., 1994). By analogy to the known role of covalent addition of ubiquitin in rendering target proteins recognizable by subunits of a large 26S proteasome, it is tempting to speculate that the BAG-1 protein plays a role in bringing Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2-binding proteins into contact with a protease-containing protein c o m p l e x that participates in cell death regulation. Previously it has been suggested that there exist both Bcl-2-dependent and Bcl-2-independent pathways for suppression of apoptosis, largely on the basis of gene transfer experiments where elevated levels of Bcl-2 protein production were shown to be insufficient to protect cells from induction of cell death by some kinds of stimuli. In particular, it has been controversial whether high levels of Bcl-2 protein correlate with resistance to apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibodies and cytolytic T cells, with Bcl-2 apparently providing protection in some cell lines but not others (Itoh et al., 1993; Owen-Schaub et al., 1994; Vaux et al., 1992a; Strasser et al., 1991; Torigoe et al., 1994b). The gene transfer experiments presented here, however, suggest that the failure of Bcl-2 to promote cell survival in at least some of these scenarios may have an explanation other than invoking the presence of a Bcl-2-independent pathway. In Jurkat T cells, for example, cotransfection of Bcl-2 and BAG-1 expression plasmids rendered these cells relatively more resistant to induction of cell death by staurosporine, anti-Fas antibody, and cytolytic T cells, whereas either Bcl-2 or BAG-1 alone was comparatively ineffective at providing protection from cell death. Clearly, therefore, the context in which BcI-2 is overexpressed is vitally important to its ability to block cell death. To the extent that partner proteins such as BAG-1 are present at insufficient levels or dominant inhibitors such as Bax or Bcl-xs are produced at excessive levels, a mere increase in Bcl-2 protein levels may be inadequate to protect some types of cells from some kinds of cell death stimuli. In these cases, the cell death pathway utilized m a y nevertheless directly involve a Bcl-2-regulable step. Experimental Procedures cDNA Library Screening A mouse embryo DNA library in ;~EX-Iox(Novagen, Incorporated) was plated on BL21(DE3) ceils and induced with isopropyl-~-o-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) according to the protocol of the manufacturer, Filters were preblocked in Hyb75 solution (20 mM HEPES [pH 7,7], 75 mM KCI, 2.5 mM MgCI2, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 5% nonfat milk for 30 min and then incubated overnight at 4°C in Hyb75 containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1% milk, and 1% lysate from bcl-2-baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (Reed et al., 1992; Newmeyer et al., 1994). After one wash for 5 rain in Hyb75, filters were incubated for 2 hr at 4°C in the same solution containing 1% nonfat milk and 0.1% (v/v) ascites from the anti-Bcl-2 antibody-producing hybridoma 4D7.4 (Reed et al., 1992). Antibody detection was accomplished by using 0.14 ~g/ml alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Promega, Incorporated) in Hyb75 with 1% milk followed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolylphosphate toluidinium-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (BCIPNBT). To convert this phage to plasmid, BM25.8 cells that contain P1 cre recombinase (Palazzolo et al., 1990) were infected and plated on ampicillin-containing LB plates.  In addition, a mouse kidney cDNA library in Zgtl0 (Clontech, Incorporated) was screened using the original bag-1 cDNA clone (pS33-1) as a 32P-labeledhybridization probe to obtain additional cDNA clones, of which ~.SN-245-9 contained nucleotides -82 to +843 bp. BAG-1 Fusion Proteins For GST-BAG-1 fusion protein, the bag-1 cDNA (pS33-1) was excised from pEX/ox-BAG-1 by digestion with EcoRI and Hindlll and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX-3X (Pharmacia, Incorporated) by use of a HindllI-EcoRI adapter. The pGEX-3X and pGEX-3X-BAG-1 plasmids were transformed into XLl-blue cells (Stratagene, Incorporated). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 into LB medium containing 50 p.g/mlampicillin, and 2 hr later, 0.1-0.2 mM IPTG was added prior to incubating cultures 12-18 hr at 30 °C with aeration. Cells were recovered from 250 ml cultures by centrifugation, resuspended in - 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and sonicated on ice by using five bursts of 30 s each from a 1.6 mm tip (Ultrasonicator model XL2020; Heat Systems, Incorporated). After centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 15-30 min, the supernatant was mixed with - 1 ml of glutathioneSepharose-4B (Pharmacia, incorporated) for 1 hr at 4°C. The beads were then washed two times in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, and the GST-BAG-1 and GST proteins were eluted by using 5 vol of 5 mM glutathione, 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0]. Filter binding assays were performed using -0.25 I~g of purified GST-BAG-1 and GST control proteins. After size fractionation of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transfer to nitrocellulose, filters were processed as described above for library screening. For binding of Bcl-2 to GST-BAG-1 protein in solution, GST control or GST-BAG-1 proteins were immobilized on glutathioneSepharose-4B ( - 0.25 p~gof protein/1 p.I of beads) that had been preblocked in 0.5% nonfat milk and 0.05% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and - 10-20 ~1was incubated for 1 hr on a rotator at 4°C with 50 I~1 of Sf9 cell lysates in 0.4 ml of binding buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCI, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 [NP-40], 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA, 50/0glycerol). Sepharose beads were then washed three times in 1 ml of TENNS buffer (2.5 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 2.5 mM EDTA, 250 mM NaCI, 1% NP-40, 2.5% sucrose), then resuspended in 20 I~1 of Laemmli buffer, and 10 tll was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot assay (12% gels) using 0.20/0 (v/v) of an anti-Bcl-2 rabbit antiserum (Reed et al., 1991) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Promega, Incorporated), followed by NBT-BCIP in 0.1 M Tris [pH 9.5], 0.1 M NaCI, 5 mM MgCI2. Antibodies and Immunoblotting Antisera were prepared in rabbits essentially as described previously (Reed et al., 1991) by using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 16 amino acids of BAG-1 (NH2-CQETERLQSTNLALAECOOH) that was conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (Pierce, Incorporated). For SDS-PAGE/immunoblot assays, blots were preblocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCI) containing both 3% BSA and 5% nonfat milk, and washes were performed using TBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies were used at 0.1%-0.2% (v/v), and detection was with 0.05% horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham, Incorporated) in TBS with 30/oBSA by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Amersham, Incorporated). Gene Transfections For BALB/c 3T3 cells, the bag-1 cDNA SN-245-9 was subcloned into the Hindlll and Xbal sites of pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, Incorporated). Scallinearized DNA (25 p~g)was mixed with 2.5 x 106 BALB/c 3T3 cells in 0.8 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.05], 137 mM NaCI, 5 mM KCI, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 6 mM dextrose) on ice. Electroporations were performed in 0.4 cm (diameter) cuvettes with platinum electrodes using 270 V and 1500 I~F (Cell Ject; EquiBio, Incorporated). Selections were begun 2 days later using medium containing 1 mg/ml geneticin (GIBCO BRL, Incorporated), and individual clones were isolated using cloning cylinders. For Jurkat T cells, the bag-1 cDNA SN-245-9 in pSK-II was excised by use of Hindlll and BamHI and subcloned into pCEP (Invitrogen, Incorporated). Jurkat cells (5 x 106)were mixed with 25 I~g of plasmid  Cell 284  DNA in 0.8 ml of HBSS and electroporated using 270 V and 900 p.F. After 2 days, cells were seeded at 10s cells/ml in medium containing 1 mg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem, Incorporated).  Cytotoxicity Assays Jurkat cells were cultured for various times at 5 × 105 cells/ml in 96-well flat-bottomed plates (Falcon, Incorporated) (0.2 ml/well) containing 1 ~tg/ml 2D1 antibody (Takahashi et al., 1993), 10 ~M staurosporine (Sigma, Incorporated), or none of these reagents. BALB/c 3T3 cells were cultured with or without 1 I~M staurospodne at 104 ceils per flat-bottomed well. Relative numbers or percentages of viable cells were determined by trypan blue dye exclusion or 3[4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay as described previously (Kitada et al., 1994). For CTL experiments, Jurkat cells were labeled with S~Crand cultured for 4 hr with CTLs at an E/T ratio of 20/1. The percentage specific S~Crrelease was then calculated by correction for spontaneous release and normalization for total release induced by 1% NP-40 as described (Torigoe et al., 1994a, 1994b).

<BodyText>Published February 1, 1995  Syntrophin Binds to an Alternatively Spliced Exon of Dystrophin Andrew H. Ahn* and Louis M. Kunkel* *Program in Neuroscience and Medical Scientist Training Program, Harvard Medical School; and *Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115  Abstract. Dystrophin, the protein product of the Ducherme muscular dystrophy locus, is a protein of the membrane cytoskeleton that associates with a complex of integral and membrane-associated proteins. Of these, the 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated protein, syntrophin, was recently shown to consist of a family of three related but distinct genes. We expressed the eDNA of human Brsyntrophin and the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in reticulocyte lysates using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Using antibodies to dystrophin we immunoprecipitated these two interacting proteins in a variety of salt and detergent conditions. We demonstrate that the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin, an  alternatively spliced exon, are necessary and sufficient for interaction with translated fll-syntrophin in our assay. On the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin may thus be present in two functionally distinct populations. In this recombinant expression system, the dystrophin relatives, human dystrophin related protein (DRP or utrophin) and the 87K postsynaptic protein from Torpedo electric organ, also bind to translated Bz-syntrophin. We have found a COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of Bi-syntrophin sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues, suggesting that the dystrophin binding site on flrsyntrophin occurs on a region that is conserved among the three syntrophin homologues.  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  UCH~NNE muscular dystrophy and the allelic disease Becker muscular dystrophy are due to defects of the dystrophin gene (Emery, 1993). Dystrophin is a membrane-associated protein found throughout the muscle sarcolemma, as well as in the postsynaptic density of a subset of neurons (Arahata et al., 1988; Lidov et al., 1990, 1993; Byers et al., 1991). The shorter dystrophin products of 116 and 71 kD, Dpll6 and DpT1 are, respectively, found in the outer membrane of Schwann cells and in many different tissues (Lederfein et al., 1992; Byers et al., 1993). In skeletal muscle dystrophin is presumed to participate in maintaining the stability of the membrane during the repeated cycles of contraction and relaxation of the muscle fiber. By establishing the functional domains and biochemical organization of dystrophin with other components of the membrane cytoskeleton, we hope to better understand its role. The autosomal relative of dystrophin, dystrophin-related protein (DRP~ or utrophin), is expressed in many cell types other than muscle (Love et al., 1989, 1991; Tinsley et al., 1992). In muscle, DRP localizes in the upper folds of the neuromuscular junction and at the myotendinous junction (Khurana et al., 1991; Ohlendieck et al., 1991; Cartaud et Address all correspondence to Louis M.

Abbreviations used in this paper: DGC, dystrophin glycoprotein complex; DRP, dystrophin-related protein; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; TMV, tobacco mosaic virus.  al., 1992). Another dystrophin relative, the 87K postsynaptic protein of Torpedo (Carr et al., 1989), also has homology to the COOH terminus of dystrophin and copurifies with dystrophin and syntrophin from electric organ extracts (Wagner et al., 1993). Proteins immunologically related to the 87K protein have also been identified in rat myotubes (Carr et al., 1989) and a wide variety of other rat tissues (Kramarcy et al., 1994). The three genes coding for dystrophin, DRP, and the 87K protein, form the closest known members of the dystrophin family. Dystmphin can be isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes by affinity chromatography to wheat germ agglutinin (Campbell and Kahl, 1989). The complex of integral and peripheral membrane proteins that copurify with dystrophin has come to be known as the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) (Yoshida and Ozawa, 1990; Ervasti and Campbell, 1991). The DGC also copurifies with the more widely expressed DRP (Matsumura et al., 1992). The syntrophins copurify with the DG-C (Yoshida and Ozawa, 1990; Ervasti and Campbell, 1991) and are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kD intracellular membrane-associated proteins (Yamamoto et al., 1993). These proteins are encoded by a family of three separate genes with distinct patterns of expression (Adams et al., 1993; Ahn et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1994) and distribution throughout the muscle membrane (Peters et al., 1994). The relatively acidic ct-syntrophin (also known as mouse syntrophin-1, rabbit 59-DAP, and Torpedo syntrophin) is most abundant in muscle (Adams et al., 1993; Yang et al., 1994).  © The Rockefeller University Press, 0021-9525/95/02/363/9 $2.00 The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 128, Number 3, February 1995 363-371  363  Published February 1, 1995  Of the two basic isoforms, fll-syntrophin is expressed in liver, pancreas, kidney, skeletal muscle, lung, placenta, and in lower levels in brain and heart (Alan et al., 1994). The B2-syntrophin (previously identified as mouse syntrophin-2) is present in low levels in many tissues (Adams et al., 1993). Subcellular localization with isoform-specific antibodies shows that tx-syntrophin is expressed throughout the entire muscle membrane. On the other hand, B2-syntrophin is found only at the postsynaptic densities of the muscle membrane (Peters et al., 1994). The cellular localization of /~l-syntrophin is yet to be shown. Syntrophin purified from the electric organ of Torpedo (Froehner et al., 1987) interacts directly with dystrophin in immuno-affinity and blot-overlay experiments (Buffer et al., 1992; Cartand et al., 1993). Quantitative immunoabsorption of dystrophin followed by immuno-absorption of syntrophin from Torpedo electroplaque extract showed that there is a distinct non-dystrophin-associated pool of syntrophin that contains the 87K protein (Buffer et al., 1992). A similar imrnuno-aflinity purification of syntrophin from several rat tissues shows that dystrophin, Dp71 isoforms, DRP, and 87K-like proteins all copurify with syntrophin (Kramarcy et al., 1994). The syntrophin binding site on dystrophin has been localized to the COOH-terminus of dystrophin (Suzuki et al., 1992, 1994). The widespread distribution of the syntrophins and their coincident expression with Dp71 and DRP in non-muscle tissues suggests that these proteins may play an analogous role to dystrophin in the membrane cytoskeleton of these other cell types (Kramarcy et al., 1994). It is possible that the specific subeellular localization of the syntrophin isoforms accounts for the specificity of localization and function of dystrophin, Dp71, and DRP. The observation that anti-87K protein or anti-syntrophin antibodies copurify 87K, dystrophin, and syntrophin led to the proposal that an arnphipathic repeated heptad motif on both dystrophin and 87K could be the basis for their association (Wagner et al., 1993). This proposal does not exclude the possibility of a distinct syntrophin binding site on both dystrophin and the 87K protein, which is supported by the copurification of 87K with syntrophin in a dystrophindepleted extract (Buffer et al., 1992). To more fully understand these relationships, ~ve have used recombinant techniques to study the syntrophin-dystrophin interaction by using an in vitro expression system. We have expressed portions of the human dystrophin gene and have mapped its site of interaction with a defined isoform of human syntrophin, Bt-syntrophin, by coimmunoprecipiration. In our assay, the 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 of dystrophin are sufficient to bind to in vitro-translated 131syntrophin. In the accompanying paper, Suzuki et al. have independently obtained a similar localization of this binding site by using a blot-overlay approach (Suzuki et al., 1995). We have also expressed a naturally occurring spliced isoform of dystrophin, in which 110 amino acids (including the 53 amino acids of exon 74) are internally deleted from the COOH terminus of dystrophin, and this isoform does not bind/51-syntrophin in our assay. This characterization of the syntrophin binding site on dystrophin suggests that, on the basis of its alternative splicing, dystrophin is present in two functionally distinct populations. In addition, we have found in our in vitro assay that the dystrophin relatives DRP and  the 87K postsynaptic protein also interact with syntrophin, demonstrating that this binding site on dystrophin is functionally conserved. The finding that syntrophin binds the three dystrophin family members suggests that they may play functionally analogous roles.  Materials and Methods Construction of a Vectorfor Transcription and Translation To facilitate efficient and processive translation of cDNAs, an expression cassette was designed and constructed from synthetic oligonucleotidesby pbosphoramidite synthetic chemistry (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). A series of partial, overlapping,and complementaryoligunucleotides with BssHII complementary ends were ligated to the plasmid Bluescript II KS+ (Stratagene Inc., CA), in which the RNA polymerase and multiple cloningsite was removedby digestionwith BssHlI. The resulting expression vector, pMGT, contains the followingfeatures (Fig. 1 a): a T7 RNA polymerase late promoter (Panayotatosand Wells, 1979); the 5' untranslated region (fl') of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (Gailie et al., 1987, 1988); an initiator ATG codon in the context of a Kozak consensus (M) (Kozak, 1986); an extensivepolylinker (MCS); stop codonsin all three reading frames; a short poly(A) region; a polyadenylatiun signal; and + other unique restriction sites for linearization of the plasmid (L). The expression vector pMGT was further modified to accommodatean EcoRI fragment in another reading frame (Table I). This modifiedvector, TR-3, was used to produce the expression construct TDR (see below). To express the octapeptide FLAGantigen 0BI) at the NH2 terminus of the expressed polypeptide,complementaryoligonucleotides(TableI) were ligated to the NcoI/BamHIsite on pMGT. The resulting vector, pFHR, permitted the introduction of inserts as BamHI/EcoRI fragments, and the translation of a fusion polypeptide with the sequence beginning MDYKDDDD K G S . . . (Table 1).  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Subcloning of cDNA's into Expression Vector PCR primers were synthesizedto amplify regions of specific cDNAs. The oligonucleotides used in the subcloning of dystrophin and all other constructs used in this report are listed in Table I (Sambrooket al., 1989). For dystrophin, 100 ng of plasmid p9-14, encodingthe entire COOH terminus of dystrophin (Koenig et ai., 1987), was used as template with 100 pmol of each primer. To maintain the fidelity of the amplified DNA, we used the thermo-stable DNA polymerase Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Sharon, MA) in all amplifications. AmplifiedDNA was cloned into pMGT using restriction enzymes indicated (Table I). To confirm the accuracy of the amplification and cloning steps, partial sequence was obtained by the dideoxy-terminator method using Taq polymeraseand analyzedon an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. Because the COOH terminus of dystrophin has numerous NcoI sites, some constructs were produced by partial digestion with NcoI and XhoI, isolated by electrophoresis, and then ligated into the expression vector. In other cases, the inserts were cloned into the KpnI to SpeI site of pMGT, resulting in a fusion protein that contains the additional amino acids MGT at the terminus of the native sequence. To introduce the seven unique amino acids at the NH: terminus of Dp71, a two-step amplification was used. The oligonucleotideF1 was used in the first round to amplify cDNA from exon 63 and then F2 in the second round to add the novel sequence (Table I). To construct Dp71All0, a naturally occurring splice variant of Dp71 missing exons 71 through74 was isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library. We isolated the SacI restriction fragment which spans the alternatively spliced exons 71-74and replacedthe SacI fragment in the expression plasmid encoding Dp71. The cDNA clone to the COOH terminus of human DRP containing the region homologousto the entire COOH terminus of dystrophin, DRP2, was kindly provided by T. S. Khurana (in our laboratory).

In cases where PCR products were not used to generate the construct, the cloning strategy is briefly described. ~:Single 1 ~ amino acid symbols are used. Amino acid numbers for human dystrophin, human flt-syntrophin, human DR.P, and Torpedo 87K protein are respectively from Koenig et al., 1988; Aim et al., 1994; Tinsley et al., 1993; and Wagner et al., 1993. In the expression of Bi-syntrophin, the eDNA clone #AI was used directly from within the Bluescript vector (Alan et al., 1994). This plasmid expressed protein at much lower levels than the expression vectors described above. To construct FjSIS, the BamI-II/ECORIfragment of the plasmid BAI was subeloned into pFHR, so that the last 335 of the 537 amino acids of Bl-syntrophin were expressed as a fusion protein with the FLAG antigen. The entire Torpedo 87K protein eDNA was kindly provided by J. B. Cohen (Wagner et al., 1993). The eDNA was subcloned into the NcoI to EcoRI site within pMGT1 in three parts: (a) an oligonucleotide linker coding for the first five amino acids of the 87K protein (see Table I); (b) the PstI to BamHI fragment (nucleotides 128-345); and (c) the BamHI to EcoRI fragment (nncleotides 346-2594) from the 87K eDNA. The insert within expression plasmid F87, coding for the region of 87K that is homologous to exon 74 of dystrophin, was PCR-amplified from this 87K eDNA (Table I). reaction volume of 50/~1 as per the manufacturer's protocol. When indicated, the reaction was carried out in a reaction buffer in which 0.2 ~Ci (4 t~l) of L-[U-t4C]leucine (&amp;gt;300 mCi/mmol; Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IT,) was added to a 50-pl reaction mix that lacked leucine. In general, the protein which is recognized by the antibody (cognate protein) was expressed without the incorporation of radioactivity, and the protein which did not interact with the antibody (probe protein) was separately expressed with [14C]leucine (as above). In some cases the cognate protein (which binds the antibody) was synthesized with 0.05 pCi of [14C]leucine added to the synthesis reaction so that the presence of the polypeptide could be followed through the immnnoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. Polypeptide secondary structure predictions were made with the University of Wisconsin GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package (Madison, WI). Immunopredpitation. Protein interactions were assayed by their coprecipitation in the following assay. Directly from the translation reaction above, 10 t~l of both cognate and probe proteins were incubated together with 20 ~1 of 10 mM Tris-buffered saline (pH 8), 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). After 2-h incubation at room temperature, 10 td of unpurified immune serum raised against the COOH terminus of dystrophin (dl 1) (Koenig and Kunkel, 1990) or 1 #1 of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2; IBI/Kodak,  Transcription and Translation of cDNA Sequences The polypeptides of interest were produced from plasmid DNA in the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in a  Ahn and Kunkel Syntrophin Binds a Spliced Exon of Dystrophin  365  Published February 1, 1995  New Haven, CT) were added with 20 ~l of TBST.

All samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on denaturing discontinuous buffer systems in 10%, 4-15%, or 4--20% acrylamide gradients (Laemmli, 1970). 14C-methylated high molecuiar weight standards (10-50/LCi/rng) were from Amersham Corp. Gels were fixed in 10% methanol/10% acetic acid, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to confirm the recovery of antibody, destuined in fix buffer, washed in water, dried onto cellulose, and exposed to a storage phosphor plate for four days. The plate was scanned by a PhosphorImnger (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed with ImngeQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The positive band activities of 50-8,000 units per pixel, depending on the probe, were easily discernible over the background pixel value of 1-15. The image was converted to an eight bit TIFF file, processed on Adobe Pbotoshop to adjust contrast and scale light levels, and labeled in Aldus SuperPaint.

These expressed proteins are synthesized in the presence of [~4C]leucine and analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 1 b). The eDNA translated from pMGT incorporates 10-1,000 times more label than from similar eDNA in the Bluescript polylinker (Fig. 1 b, lane 8 is from Bluescript). Presumably due to a favorable 5' untranslated region and a strong initiator of translation (see Materials and Methods), the pMGT vector permits the expression of analytical quantities of proteins of up to 150 kD (A. H. Ahn, unpublished observations). While determining the syntrophin-binding site on dystrophin in this present study, our collection of region-specific antibodies to dystrophin could no longer immunoprecipitate some of the smaller expressed domains of dystrophin. Hence it became necessary to produce translated proteins that were tagged with a uniformly defined, unique antigen. A synthetic oligonucleotide encoding the octapeptide FLAG antigen (IBI/Kodak) was cloned into the NcoI-BamHI site of pMGT, giving rise to the vector pFHR. Both FLAG-dystrophin (see below) and FLAG-syntrophin fusion proteins (Fig. 1 b, lane 9) were produced from pFHR, and were efficiently precipitated with the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (IBI/ Kodak).

A constant amount of in vitro-translated "C-labeled ~,-syntrophin (~A1, the probe, hereafter referred to as "translated syntrophin') was combined with a polypeptide containing amino acids 2979-3685 of dystrophin (C2979), which was expressed nonradioactively. The proteins were incubated together and the complex immunoprecipitated with an antiserum to the COOH terminus of dystrophin (dl 1) CKoenig and Kunkel, 1990) and protein-G Sepharose. The observed coimmunoprecipitation between dystrophin polypeptide and translated syntrophin persisted in 0 mM, 150 mM, and 1,000 mM NaC1 wash conditions, and was not disrupted by either 1% Triton X-100 or RIPA buffer (Fig. 2, lanes 1-5). It appears that the recovery of translated syntrophin is most efficient in no-salt conditions, but a separate control experi Characterization  of Dystrophin-Syntrophin Interaction by Immunoprecipitation The COOH terminus of dystrophin interacts with purified syntrophin immobilized onto a solid support (Cartaud et al., 1993; Suzuki et al., 1994), or when immuno-affinity purified from the receptor-rich membranes of the Torpedo electroplaque (Butler et al., 1992) or from several rat tissues (Kramarcy et al., 1994). To confirm and better understand this interaction with a single isoform of syntrophin in the soluble phase, we translated various portions of the dystro The  Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 128, 1995  366  Published February 1, 1995  ment showed that the greater translated syntrophin activity in the pellet is accounted for by the efficiency with which the anti-dystrophin antibody precipitates dystrophin (data not shown). In our controls for specificity, withholding either dystrophin or the anti-dystrophin antibody from the reaction failed to precipitate the translated syntrophin, and addition of an antibody against the amino terminus of dystrophin, which does not precipitate the COOH terminus alone, failed to precipitate the complex (Fig. 2, lanes 6-8).  Figure 2. Coprecipitation of COOH-terminal dystrophin polypeptide (C2979) with translated radiolabeled syntrophin, using the anti-dystrophin antibody dll. After incubation with protein G-Sepharose, the samples were washed three times in Tris buffer and 0.1% Tween-20 with 0 mM NaC1 (I), 150 mM NaC1 (2), 1,000 mM NaCI (3), TBST with 1% Triton X-100 (4), or RIPA buffer (5). No translated syntrophin was precipitated in the absence of dystrophin polypeptide (6), or antiserum (7), or when a nonspecific antibody to the NH2 terminus of dystrophin, 1-2a (8) (Koenig and Kunkel, 1990) was used.  Translated Syntrophin Interacts with the Differentially Spliced Area of Dystrophin The structural requirements of the dystrophin-syntrophin interaction were more precisely characterized by creating a set of nested dystrophin products of the COOH terminus of dystrophin and DpT1 (Fig. 3 a). Like sequences derived from full sized dystrophin, Dp71, which contains only seven unique amino acids at its NH2 terminus, also binds translated syntrophin in a similar assay. COOH-terminal deletions of Dp71, up to 148 amino acids (DpT1A148), continued to bind translated syntrophin, while a protein with a deletion of 276 amino acids (Dp71A276) failed to bind (Fig. 3 a, lane Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Figure 3.

Anti-dystrophin antibody dl 1 (a) or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (b) coprecipitated dystrophin polypeptides with translated syntrophin.

The lower portion shows the autoradiographic data from the assay (see Materials and Methods). (a) A series of COOH-terminal dystrophin polypeptides (1 and 2) and a translated Dp71 polypeptide (3) coprecipitate translated syntrophin. A 148-amino acid COOH-terminal deletion of Dp71 still binds translated syntrophin (4), but a larger deletion of 276 amino acids fails to bind (5). A polypeptide spanning the alternatively spliced region binds translated syntrophin (6), whereas an expressed polypeptide that represents a naturally occurring splice variant of Dp71 which is missing this region fails to bind (7). Control assays in which the dystrophin polypeptide (-dys) or the antibody (-Ab) were withheld are negative. (b) FLAG--dystrophin fusion polypeptides encoding exons 72-74 coprecipitate translated syntrophin (1), as do FLAG-fusion polypeptides representing exons 73-74 (2) or exon 74 alone (3 and 4). FLAG-fusion polypeptides of only portions of exon 74 (5 and 6) failed to coprecipitate translated syntrophin. Control assays in which the dystrophin polypeptide (-dys) or the antibody (-Ab) were withheld are negative.  Ahn and KunkelSyntrophinBint~ a SplicedExon of Dystrophin  367  Published February 1, 1995  5). The protein encoded by C3356A148, corresponding to amino acids 3356-3537 of dystrophin (from the end of exon 70 to the beginning of exon 75), also bound translated syntrophin (Fig. 3 a, lane 6). Dystrophin amino acids 3356-3537 include those encoded on exons 71 through 74, which axe known to be alternatively spliced in skeletal muscle, brain, and heart (Feener et al., 1989; Bies et ai., 1992). The alternative splicing generates transcripts that are missing various in-frame combinations of these exons, including forms that lack this entire region, amino acids 3409-3518 of dystrophin. We expressed a Dp71 protein in which the 110 amino acids encoded by exons 71-74 were internally deleted (Dp 71All0) and showed that it failed to bind syntrophin in our assay (Fig. 3 a, lane 7). A nested series of expression constructs were used to express progressively smaller portions of this alternatively spliced region of dystrophin (Fig, 3 b). Since the available antibodies to dystrophin do not immunoprecipitate this region alone, we cloned amplified eDNA into pFHR, introducing amino-terminal fusions of the FLAG octapeptide with the proteins of interest. The FLAG-dystrophin fusion proteins also bound translated syntrophin when immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Fig. 3 b). In each case, precipitation of translated syntrophin depended upon the inclusion of dystrophin fusion protein to the assay, and the dystrophin-syntrophin complex did not precipitate in the absence of M2 antibody (Fig. 3 b, lanes "-dys" and "-Ab"). A FLAG-dystrophin fusion protein including the amino acids encoded on exon 74 (F74-01) was sufficient to bind translated syntrophin (Fig 3 b, lane 4). FLAG-dystrophin fusion proteins of the first or second half of exon 74 (F74A and F74B) failed to coprecipitate translated syntrophin in our assay (Fig. 3 b, lanes 5 and 6).  As a further control of specificity, we performed the converse immunoprecipitation, in which a radiolabeled dystrophin COOH terminus and an unlabeled syntrophin polypeptide were combined and precipitated with an antibody to the translated syntrophin polypeptide. In this instance, we subcloned the eDNA encoding the last 335 amino acids of/31syntrophin into the FLAG fusion vector (pFHR). This FLAG-syntrophin fusion protein, F/3~S (Fig. 1 b, lane 9), together with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2, specifically coimmunoprecipitated the COOH terminus of dystrophin (Fig. 4 a, lane 1 ).  DRP and 87K Polypeptides Also Bind Translated Syntrophin To examine whether the exon 74-encoded region on dystrophin is functionally preserved in the two other dystrophin relatives, human DRP and the Torpedo 87K postsynaptic protein, we tested translated DRP and 87K probes in a similax assay. A large COOH terminal portion of DRP and all of the 87K protein were produced as radiolabeled polypeptides. The FLAG-syntrophin fusion protein coprecipitates both the translated DRP and 87K proteins, and fails to precipitate when the FLAG-syntrophin fusion protein or the anti-FLAG antibody axe omitted from the assay (Fig. 4 a). The converse experiment was also performed, in which the FLAG-antigen was switched to the other polypeptide. Based upon the localization of the syntrophin binding site on dystrophin, the exon 74 homologous regions of DRP and 87K were expressed as FLAG-fusion proteins. All three FLAG-fusion proteins of dystrophin, DRP, and 87K immunoprecipitate the translated full-length/3~-syntrophin probe, whereas their complexes do not precipitate in the absence of M2 antibody (Fig. 4 b).  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Figure4. The syntrophinbinding site is functionally conserved among the three dystrophin family members. (a) The FLAG-syntrophin fusion protein F/3~S was incubated with radiolabeledpolypeptides of the COOH terminus of dystrophin (1), the COOH terminus of DRP (2), and the 87K protein (3) and precipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The control reactions in which all three dystrophin family members were used in the absence of F/31S (4) or in the absence of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (5) are negative. (b) The interaction is preserved when the FLAG antigen has been switched to the other protein. Radiolabeled syntrophin (dark arrow) was incubated with FLAG fusions of the exon 74-encoded region of dystrophin (/) the FLAG-fusion protein (the lower band) incorporated the radiolabel poorly, and is not easily seen in this exposure), the FLAG fusion of the homologous region of DRP (2) and the FLAG fusion of the homologous region of 87K protein (3) and precipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The presence of the FLAG-fusion proteins (light arrows) were followed by the addition of a small amount of [14C]leucineto their translation reactions (see Materials and Methods). Precipitation of syntrophin depended on the addition of the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (4). An assay-equivalentof translat~l syntrophin is shown for comparison (5). (c) alignment of the amino acid sequences of exon 74 of dystrophin and their homologous region from DRP and the 87K protein. Gaps in the sequence were made to maintain the alignment. The consensus line (con) lists the identical residues of the alignment (single letter abbreviation) and conservative differences (*).  The Journalof Cell Biology,Volume 128, 1995  368  Published February 1, 1995  To look for sequence trends that may define a/~-syntrophin binding motif, an alignment of the 53 amino acids homologous to exon 74 of dystrophin in DRP and the 87K protein was prepared (Fig. 4 c). Exon 74-encoded amino acids are represented in capital single-letter amino acid abbreviations. (An additional 2-4 amino acids from either side of exon 74 were expressed from the constructs F74-01, FDR, and F87 and are described in Table I.) Only 24% of the residues in the area shown are identical in all three proteins, and they are 45 % similar when conservative differences are considered. The homology is dispersed throughout the exonencoded region, and the highly acidic residues in dystrophin and DRP are not always conserved in the 87K protein.  Discussion The 58-kD peripheral intracellular dystrophin-associated phosphoprotein called syntrophin is a biochemically heterogeneous (Yamamoto et al., 1993) family of three isoforms encoded on three distinct genes (Adams et al., 1993; Alan et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1994). These proteins are expressed in a wide variety of tissues, each in an overlapping and distinct pattern of expression. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical localization of ot-syntrophin and /~-syntrophin has shown that they have a segregated subcellular distribution. Localization of ot-syntrophin to the entire sarcolemma and /$2-syntrophin to the neuromuscular junction has led to the hypothesis that the syntrophins may in part account for the distinct localization and perhaps functioning of dystrophin and DRP (Peters et al., 1994). Immunoaffinlty isolation of syntrophin from a large range of rat tissues shows that dystrophin, Dp71, and DRP each copurify with the syntrophins, and the respective converse immuno-affinlty purifications show that dystrophin and DRP probably interact with syntrophin independently of each other (Kramarcy et al., 1994). The biochemical heterogeneity of both the dystrophins and the syntrophins isolated from tissues, however, makes this interaction difficult to study in further detail. To reconstruct and test these proposed interactions individually, we have expressed these components from cDNA in vitro. A defined isoform of human syntrophin,/3rsyntrophin (Ahn et al., 1994), interacts with the COOH terminus of human dystrophin in an immunoprecipitation assay. The specificity of the dystrophin-syntrophin interaction was verified in a number of conditions (Fig																							. 2). First, the interaction is stable in a wide variety of salt and detergent conditions. Second, syntrophin remains in the supernatant when dystrophin COOH terminus is omitted from the precipitation. Third, the dystrophin-syntrophin complex remains in the supernatant in the absence of antibody to the COOH terminus of dystrophin, and does not precipitate when a non-specific antibody is added. Finally, in the converse precipitation, a FLAG-syntrophin fusion protein of the COOH terminal 37 kD of/~-syntrophin can coprecipitate a translated, radiolabeled dystrophin fragment (Fig. 4 a). Since Dp71 differs from dystrophin by only seven amino acids at its NH2 terminus, we were not surprised to find that Dp71 also coprecipitates translated syntrophin (Fig. 3 a). This result is in agreement with an independent set of experiments, in which Dp71 immuno-affinitypurified from rat liver copurified with syntrophin (Kramarcy et al., 1994). We have mapped a syntrophin binding site on dystrophin  to exon 74, a region which is alternatively spliced in skeletal muscle, brain, and heart. In our assay, this region of dystrophin is necessary to coprecipitate translated syntrophin, since the translated product of a splice variant which lacks this region does not coprecipitate translated syntrophin probe (Fig. 3 a, lane 7). Since the translated polypeptide Dp71All0 represents a naturally occurring splice variant of dystrophin and Dp71, this polypeptide is more likely to fold correctly than an arbitrary deletion mutant. It is still possible that another region of dystrophin also interacts with syntrophin, but in our assay, its interaction alone is not strong enough to coprecipitate translated syntrophin in the absence of exons 71-74. Another possibility is that our polyclonal anti-dystrophin antibody (dl I) interferes with the binding activity of another COOH-terminal region of dystrophin. This other part of dystrophin may play a regulatory or modulatory role in the interaction between dystrophin and one or more of the syntrophins. In the accompanying paper, an independent series of experiments by Suzuki and colleagues suggest that a-syntrophin and /~-syntrophin have slightly different binding sites, but both reside substantially within exon 74. They also suggest that a further weak interaction exists between syntrophin and the far COOH terminus of dystrophin (Suzuki et al., 1995).  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  The Exon 74-encoded Polypeptide Is Functionally Conserved The syntrophin-binding site on dystrophin is functionally conserved in the dystrophin relatives DRP and 87K protein (Fig. 4, a and b). We have not ruled out the possibility that other regions of DRP and 87K also interact with syntrophin. The functional conservation of this domain is particularly revealing in that the 87K protein is so distantly related to dystrophin (Fig. 4 c). Whereas the syntrophin-binding domains of dystrophin and DRP contain many acidic residues, the 87K protein conserves only a few of these. The stability of the dystrophin-syntrophin interaction in high salt conditions also argues against the interaction being purely electrostatic in nature (Fig. 2). Rather, the conserved sequence is dispersed throughout the exon-encoded region and includes both charged and hydrophobic residues (Fig. 4 c). Pairwise comparison of the 87K protein to the homologous region of dystrophin shows that this particular region is no more conserved between the two proteins than the rest of the protein (Wagner et al., 1993). The 53 amino acids encoded on exon 74 are predicted to be alpha-helical, bisected by at least one proline that is conserved in all three proteins. Expression constructs that divide exon 74 into these two smaller helical regions alone, however, do not bind syntrophin (Fig. 3 b). This exon-encoded region may thus form a helix-turn-helix domain which is necessary for the formation of a binding site to syntrophin. It is also possible that this relatively small region does not form any significant tertiary structure, and instead acts as a signal peptide for its association with syntrophin. This kind of interaction is observed between the src SH2 domain and six residues of a high-affinity l 1-residue phosphopeptide (PQ(pY)EEI), whose crystal structure was recently determined (Waksman et al., 1993). The exon 74-encoded region is distinct from the amphipathic helical region identified by Wagner as a possible site of dystrophin interaction with the  Ahn and Kunkel Syntrophin Binds a Spliced Exon of Dystrophin  369  Published February 1, 1995  87K protein (Wagner et al., 1993). Although several leucines and other hydrophobic residues are conserved in the consensus sequence, the repeated heptad motif characteristic of the leucine zipper is not strongly evident in the helical regions of this exon.  The Dystrophin-Syntrophin Interaction in the Membrane Cytoskeleton The exon 74-encoded region on dystrophin may help localize dystrophin and its relatives to the membrane cytoskeleton. On the other hand, it may be dystrophin and its relatives that direct the segregated distribution of the syntrophins. We have found that a recombinant COOH-terminal 37-kD fragment of syntrophin is sufficient to interact with translated dystrophin and its homologues in our assay (Fig. 4 a). Since the COOH termini of all three syntrophins are relatively wellconserved compared to their NH2 termini ( A h n e t al., 1994), their affinities for each of the dystrophins and dystrophin relatives should be preserved. The specialized subcellular localization of the syntrophins and dystrophins may thus be determined by either quantitative differences in pairwise affinity or in other modifying factors. One modifying factor that may address qualitative or quantitative differences in the dystrophin-syntrophin interaction may reside in the phosphorylation of syntrophin. Syntrophin is phosphorylated at both serine and tyrosine residues (Yamamoto et al., 1993; Wagner and Huganir, 1994). In addition, dystrophin itself may be phosphorylated at a serine and/or threonine residue at a site distal to the exon 74-encoded region (Milner et al., 1993; Madhavan and Jarrett, 1994). The role of the dystrophin-syntrophin interaction may be elucidated by the relationship of this complex to other components of the DGC and membrane cytoskeleton. Results from other groups suggest that the molecular organization of dystrophin with other components of the DGC is complicated. An mdx mouse bearing a transgene of dystrophin with an internal deletion of exons 71-74 restores the DGC members to the sarcolemma, and restores many features of norreal muscle histology (Rafael et al., 1994). It is not known whether syntrophin functions normally at the membrane in this mouse. This result suggests one of two mutually compatible alternatives: either syntrophin's association with other members of the complex is sufficient for localization and stability or there is a separate site on dystrophin which forms a physiologically significant interaction with syntrophin in vivo which we do not observe in vitro.  preparation; and J. S. Chamberlain, manuscript in preparation; A. H. Ahn and L. M. Kunkel, unpublished observations). Since these variably spliced forms are present in low proportion to the full-length transcript (Bies et al., 1992), this result implies that there is a small pool of dystrophin that does not associate directly with syntrophin. Their relative scarcity, however, does not rule out the possibility that they play a significant role in some specialization of the cytoskeleton. The authors would like to thank E. M. McNally, H. S.

Are Both Dystrophin and Dp71 Alternatively Spliced? Exons 68, 71-74, and 78 of dystrophin are alternatively spliced in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, brain, and various fetal tissues (Feener et al., 1989; Bies et al., 1992). These studies do not distinguish between the alternative splicing of the full-length dystrophin and the COOH-termihal transcript Dp71, which is present in all tissues except adult skeletal muscle. Since the binding site localization to this region suggests that the differential splicing of dystrophin is of functional significance, this distinction is now particularly relevant. Independent studies carded out in different organisms and tissues suggest that spliciforms of exon 74 are present in both dystrophin and Dp71 (D. C. Gorecki, in  Aim, A. H., M. Yoshida, M. D. S.

																									<Abstract>A few general transcription factors, in particular TFIID and TFIIB, have been found to bind transcriptional activators. Here we show that the general transcription factor TFIIF is also a target for a transcriptional activator, namely serum response factor (SRF), which binds to the c-fos promoter. Using a yeast interaction assay, we find that SRF binds the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF and that SRF's transcriptional activation domain is the region involved in this binding. Further, RAP74's central charged cluster domain is required for binding to SRF's activation domain. Deletion of this domain impairs RAP74's ability to support SRF-activated transcription in vitro but has little effect on the protein's basal transcription activity or its ability to support SP1-activated transcription. The correlation of SRF-RAP74 binding with transcriptional activation suggests that RAP74 is a critical target for SRF-activated transcription.</Abstract>

																									<Abstract>Nerve growth factor binds independently to two transmembrane receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the p140trk (trkA) tyrosine kinase receptor, which are both co-expressed in the majority of neuronal cells that respond to NGF. Previous findings have suggested that appropriate co-expression of the two receptors gives rise to high affinity NGF binding sites and increased neurotrophin responsiveness; however, evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between the two receptors in cell lines has been lacking. Here we have utilized affinity crosslinking agents with 125I-NGF to detect an association of trkA and p75 receptors in embryonic spinal cord and brain tissues enriched in the two receptors. Although multimeric complexes of trkA and p75 were not detected by affinity crosslinking, immunoprecipitation of cross-linked NGF-receptor complexes with trk-specific antibodies resulted in selective immunoprecipitation of crosslinked p75. Our results indicate that the trkA and p75 receptors can potentially interact, and that such an association may be responsible for the generation of high affinity NGF binding sites.</Abstract>

																									<Abstract>The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.</Abstract>

																								<BodyText>The protein encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) functions as a tumour suppressor and negative growth regulator. As actively growing cells require the ongoing synthesis of ribosomal RNA, we considered that Rb might interact with the ribosomal DNA transcription apparatus. Here we report that (1) there is an accumulation of Rb protein in the nucleoli of differentiated U937 cells which correlates with inhibition of rDNA transcription; (2) addition of Rb to an in vitro transcription system inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase I; (3) this inhibition requires a functional Rb pocket; and (4) Rb specifically inhibits the activity of the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor) in vitro. This last observation was confirmed by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation, which demonstrated an interaction between Rb and UBF. These results indicate that there is an additional mechanism by which Rb suppresses cell growth, namely that Rb directly represses transcription of the rRNA genes.</BodyText>

																									<Abstract>The beta:beta activin homodimer and alpha:beta inhibin heterodimer are mutual antagonists which share a common beta subunit. Recently, it has been shown that, similar to transforming growth factor-beta 1, activin is an inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis. The activin receptor appears to be an obligatory complex of genetically distinct type I and II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Activin type I receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, were first cloned from well differentiated human hepatoma cells (HepG2). This prompted us to investigate the binding of activin and inhibin to receptors from HepG2 cells and the effect of the two ligands on DNA synthesis. Here we show that beta:beta activin binds to the activin type II receptor kinase (ActRII) which induces activin binding to the type I receptor kinase SKR2 to form ActRII.beta:beta.SKR2 complexes in which an activin beta chain occupies each receptor subunit. Inhibin also binds to ActRII through its beta subunit, competes with the binding of activin to ActRII, but fails to form the ActRII.SKR2 complex. No specific binding site for inhibin could be demonstrated in HepG2 cells. Inhibin, which had no activity of its own, antagonized the inhibitory effect of activin on DNA synthesis. The results suggest that inhibin may be a natural antagonist of assembly of the heterodimeric activin receptor complex through a dominant-negative mechanism.</Abstract>

We recently demonstrated that inhibin/activin alpha-, beta A-, and beta_SP_ _SP_B-subunit messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are localized in a variety of embryonic_SP_ _SP_rat tissues from 12-20 days post coitum (pc) and reported localizations_SP_ _SP_consistent with possible growth effects of activin during rat_SP_ _SP_embryogenesis. In the present study, we examined the tissue- specific_SP_ _SP_distribution of mRNAs encoding all known players of the inhibin/activin_SP_ _SP_system. In situ hybridization with radiolabeled RNA probes specific for_SP_ _SP_mouse activin receptors (ActRII and ActRIIB), rat follistatin, and rat_SP_ _SP_inhibin/activin subunits was used to examine the spatiotemporal expression_SP_ _SP_of these molecules in adjacent sections of postimplantation rat embryos_SP_ _SP_(8-20 days pc) as well as in midgestation placenta and uterine tissues_SP_ _SP_(8-12 days pc). With the exception of the dorsal root ganglion and salivary_SP_ _SP_gland, alpha- and beta B-subunit mRNAs were found exclusively in_SP_ _SP_reproductive tissues (brain, pituitary, and/or gonads). beta A-Subunit mRNA_SP_ _SP_signal was observed in the brain and gonads as well as in a variety of_SP_ _SP_other tissues during embryogenesis. ActRII mRNA was found exclusively in_SP_ _SP_neuronal tissue from 14 days pc until birth. ActRIIB mRNA was also found in_SP_ _SP_brain, spinal cord, and ganglion, but usually appeared earlier in_SP_ _SP_development than the ActRII message. ActRIIB message was also expressed in_SP_ _SP_a number of other tissues, in some cases along with beta A-subunit mRNA. In_SP_ _SP_these tissues, ActRIIB expression was confined to epithelial and_SP_ _SP_endothelial cell types. Follistatin message was observed in all tissues_SP_ _SP_(except the heart and vessels) localizing beta A-subunit and/or ActRIIB but_SP_ _SP_not in the same cell type. Outside the embryo, beta A-subunit mRNA was_SP_ _SP_localized in the decidua capsularis during midgestation, whereas ActRIIB_SP_ _SP_message was found in placenta as early as 9 days pc. Expression of_SP_ _SP_follistatin message was apparent in decidua from 8-11 days pc, then_SP_ _SP_disappeared from this tissue and was abundant in myometrium at 12 days pc._SP_ _SP_These data suggest that: 1) inhibin and activin regulate aspects of the_SP_ _SP_fetal reproductive system, whereas activin A may regulate the growth and_SP_ _SP_differentiation of many embryonic tissues; 2) ActRII and ActRIIB serve_SP_ _SP_different roles during development of the rat embryo; and 3) follistatin is_SP_ _SP_in a position to modulate the effects of activin during postimplantation_SP_ _SP_rat embryogenesis.

																										<Abstract>We have cloned cDNAs encoding three novel TAFIIs [TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors] from the human (h) HeLa cell TFIID complexes hTAFII28, hTAFII20 and hTAFII18. hTAFII28 is a core hTAFII present in both of the previously described hTFIID species which either lack or contain hTAFII30 (hTFIID alpha and hTFIID beta respectively), and is the homologue of Drosophila (d)TAFII30 beta. hTAFII18 is a novel hTAFII which shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFIISPT3, but has no known Drosophila counterpart. In contrast to hTAFII28, hTAFII18 is a TFIID beta-specific hTAFII. hTAFII20 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAFII30 alpha (p32). Using a combination of protein affinity chromatography and cotransfection and immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions among the novel hTAFIIs and between the novel hTAFIIs and hTAFII30 or TBP. We show that hTAFII28 interacts with hTAFII18 both in vitro and intracellularly; in contrast to its Drosophila homologue, hTAFII28 also interacts directly with TBP. Deletion analysis indicates that TBP and hTAFII18 bind to distinct domains of hTAFII28. hTAFII18 also interacts with TBP, but it interacts more strongly with hTAFII28 and hTAFII30. The binding of hTAFII28 and hTAFII30 requires distinct domains of hTAFII18. As observed with the homologous Drosophila proteins, hTAFII20 interacts directly with TBP; however, additional interactions between hTAFII20 and hTAFII28 or hTAFII30 were detected.

In contrast to hTAF1128, hTAF1118 is a TFIIDP-specific hTAFII. hTAF1120 is the homologue of p22, an alternatively spliced form of dTAF,130a (p32).

Key words: Drosophila TAFIs/protein-protein interactions/RNA polymerase II transcription factors/TBPassociated factors (TAFII)/yeast TAF11s  Introduction Regulated transcription by RNA polymerase II requires the formation of multiprotein preinitiation complexes at the promoters of transcribed genes. These multiprotein complexes comprise RNA polymerase II, factors required for basal transcription from minimal promoters in vitro  [TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH and the TATA-binding protein (TBP)] (for reviews see Roeder, 1991; Conaway and Conaway, 1993; Buratowski, 1994, and references therein), and factors required for regulated transcription, such as TFIIA and TFIID (DeJong and Roeder, 1993; Ma et al., 1993; Yokomori et al., 1993a, 1994; Lieberman and Berk, 1994; Ozer et al., 1994; Sun et al., 1994; and see above reviews). The activity of the basal transcription machinery can be modulated by transactivator proteins bound to cis-acting regulatory elements located upstream or downstream of the transcription start site. Some transactivators interact directly in vitro with components of the basal preinitiation complex (e.g. TBP, TFIIB and TFIIH; see Hemandez, 1993; Tjian and Maniatis, 1994, and references therein). However, transcriptional activation also appears to require coactivators, for example the yeast ADA proteins and the mammalian CBP or PC4 proteins, which may act as bridging molecules linking transactivators to the basal transcription factors (Arlas et al., 1994; Ge and Roeder, 1994; Kretzschmar et al., 1994a,b; Kwok et al., 1994; Marcus et al., 1994). Such coactivators can be separated easily from the basal transcription factors, while others are tightly associated with TBP in the TFIID complex [TBP-associated factors (TAF11s); reviewed in Gill and Tjian, 1992; Pugh and Tjian, 1992; Hemandez, 1993; Tjian and Maniatis, 1994]. The TAFI, composition of TFIID complexes from Drosophila embryos (dTAF11s) and human HeLa cells (hTAF,,s) has been determined (Dynlacht et al., 1991; Pugh and Tjian, 1991; Tanese et al., 1991; Timmers et al., 1992; Zhou et al., 1992, 1993; Brou et al., 1993a; Chiang et al., 1993; Kokubo et al., 1993a), and cDNAs encoding many of the dTAF11s have been cloned (Dynlacht et al., 1993; Goodrich et al., 1993; Hisatake et al., 1993; Hoey et al., 1993; Kokubo et al., 1993b, 1994; Ruppert et al., 1993; Weinzierl et al., 1993a,b; Yokomori et al., 1993b; Verrijzer et al., 1994). Recombinant dTAF11250 (Ruppert et al., 1993; designated p230 in Hisatake et al., 1993) and dTAF,130c (Yokomori et al., 1993b; p28 in Kokubo et al., 1994) interact directly with dTBP, whereas others are recruited to TFIID by TAF-TAF interactions (Weinzierl et al., 1993a,b; Chen et al., 1994). Functional analysis has revealed that some TAF11s may function as bridging molecules required for the activity of transcriptional activators. dTAFII 110 (p1 10 in Kokubo et al., 1993b) interacts directly with the transcriptional activator Sp I in vitro (Hoey et al., 1993; Gill et al., 1994). On the other hand dTAF,140 (p42 in Kokubo et al., 1994) interacts with the acidic activator VP16 and with the basal transcription factors TBP and TFIIB, thus forming a ternary complex between a transactivator and two components of the basal transcription complex (Goodrich et al., 1993). In hTFIID, a direct interaction between hTAF1130 and the region of the oestrogen receptor (ER), which harbours the activation  1 1520 0 Oxford University Press  Cloning of human TAFIs  function 2a active in yeast (AF-2a; Pierrat et al., 1994), has been detected in vitro (Jacq et al., 1994). Furthermore, the hTFIID species containing hTAF1130 was shown to be required for a ligand-independent ER AF-2 activity in vitro (Jacq et al., 1994). These results support the idea that transcriptional activation involves direct contacts between transcriptional activators and TAF11s, and that different TAF11s may mediate the function of distinct transcriptional activators (Chen et al., 1994). At present cDNAs encoding the human homologues of two dTFIID subunits, hTAF11250 (dTAF11250, identical to the product of the CCGI gene; Sekiguchi et al., 1991; Hisatake et al., 1993; Ruppert et al., 1993) and hTAF1170 (dTAF1160; Weinzierl et al., 1993b), have been cloned. The amino acid sequences of these Drosophila and human TAF11s are highly conserved, and analogous TAF-TAF and TAF-TBP interactions have been observed in Drosophila and human TFIID with these TAF11s. However, despite these similarities, differences between human and Drosophila TFIID have been noted. hTFIID appears to comprise more subunits than dTFIID (Brou et al., 1993a; Chiang et al., 1993). This was confirmed by the isolation of the cDNA encoding hTAF1130, for which no Drosophila homologue is known (Jacq et al., 1994). Moreover, all of the dTAF11s isolated from Drosophila embryos appear to be present in a single TFIID species, whereas we have shown previously that HeLa cells contain several chromatographically separable TFIID complexes with distinct functional properties (Brou et al., 1993a,b). Further, we have shown that the TFIID complexes present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts can be separated into two species, which either lack (designated hereafter hTFIIDct) or contain (hTFIIDP) hTAF1130 (Jacq et al., 1994). Interestingly, hTFIIDax and hTFIID,B were found to differ further in their subunit composition. hTAF1 17 (designated hereafter hTAF1l1 8), 20, 37 and 125 appeared to be preferentially associated with hTFIID3, and hTAF1129, 64, 106 and 150 appeared to be preferentially associated with hTFIIDa. In contrast, hTAF1128, 60, 85, 100, 135 and 250 were detected in both TFIIDa and TFIID,I (Jacq et al., 1994; Figure 3A). It appears, therefore, that hTAF11s can be divided into (i) common (core) TAF11s present in both the TFIIDa and TFIIDf complexes, and (ii) specific hTAF11s which are selectively present in hTFIIDcx or hTFIIDP. We report here the isolation of cDNAs encoding three novel subunits of HeLa cell TFIID: hTAF1128, hTAF1120 and hTAFI11 8. hTAF1128 is a core TAFI present in both hTFIIDa and hTFIIDP, and is the homologue of dTAF1130P, while hTAF1120 is the homologue of p22 (Kokubo et al., 1994), an alternatively spliced form of dTAF,130c. In contrast, hTAFI,1 8 is a novel TAFI with no known Drosophila counterpart, and is preferentially associated with hTFIID,B. Using a combination of in vitro and intracellular protein-protein interaction assays, we have determined multiple specific TAF-TAF and TAF-TBP interactions amongst the newly cloned hTAF11s and between the novel hTAF11s and hTAF1130.  Results cDNAs encoding hTAF1118, hTAF,,20 and hTAF,128 TFIID complexes were partially purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts by chromatography on a heparin-ultrogel  column (Brou et al., 1993a; Chaudhary et al., 1994), and the TFIID was immunopurified from the 0.6 M KCl fraction using an anti-TBP mAb (Jacq et al., 1994; see Materials and methods). Following SDS-PAGE, the hTAF11s were transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) membrane and the 28, 20 and 18 kDa subunits (see Figure 3A), corresponding to putative core and specific hTAF11s (see Introduction), were digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated by reversephase chromatography, and several peptide sequences were obtained for each protein (listed in Materials and methods). Degenerate oligonucleotides based on these peptide sequences were used to screen a random-primed HeLa cell cDNA library. Three clones hybridizing to the two oligonucleotide probes derived from hTAF1128 were isolated and their DNA sequences determined (Figure 1A). The deduced open reading frame (ORF) encodes a 211 amino acid protein, with a calculated molecular mass of 27.1 kDa containing both of the tryptic peptides derived from the purified HeLa cell hTAF1128 subunit (underlined in Figure 1A). Comparison with the previously identified dTAF11s indicated that hTAF1128 is the homologue of dTAF1,30I (Yokomori et al., 1 993b; Figure 1 B). The human and Drosophila proteins are 50% identical overall, with the C-terminal region being better conserved than the N-terminal region (Figure 1B). Two oligonucleotide probes derived from hTAF1120 peptides were used to screen the HeLa cell cDNA library, and six clones were isolated. The cDNA sequence (Figure 1C) contains an ORF of 161 amino acids encoding a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 20.7 kDa, comprising the four tryptic peptide sequences obtained from the purified hTAFI20 subunit (Figure 1C). Comparison with the dTAF11s indicated that hTAF1120 is the homologue of p22 (Kokubo et al., 1994), an alternatively spliced form of dTAF1130a (Yokomori et al., 1993b). The human and Drosophila proteins are 53% identical and, as observed for hTAF1128 and dTAF1130p, the homology is higher in the C-terminal region than in the N-terminal region (Figure 1D). Five clones hybridizing to oligonucleotides derived from the purified hTAFI, 18 subunit were isolated and sequenced. The cDNA encodes a 124 amino acid protein of 16.5 kDa comprising both of the tryptic peptide sequences derived from the endogenous hTAF1 1 8 (Figure 2A). Comparison of the sequence of hTAF111 8 with those of the dTAF11s did not reveal any similarity. Thus, hTAFI 18 appears to be a novel human TAFII. However, a fastaA (Pearson and Lipman, 1988) search of the Swiss Prot database revealed that the amino acid sequence of hTAFI 18 shares homology with two yeast proteins. hTAF1118 is 28% identical (59% similarity) to the yeast protein FUN 81 (Dubois et al., 1987; Figure 2B). This protein has been shown to be essential for vegetative yeast growth, but its function is unknown. FUN 81 may therefore be a yeast TAFII. Interestingly, hTAF1118 is also 26.5% identical (48% similarity) to the N-terminal region (amino acids 2-102) of the yeast TAFI, SPT3 (Eisenmann et al., 1992; Figure 2C). hTAF1118 is preferentially associated with TFIIDI, whereas hTAF1,28 is a core TAFI, To determine the distribution of the novel hTAFIs in the TFIIDcx and TFIIDI species (i.e. lacking or containing  1521  G.Mengus et al.

To separate TFIIDa from TFIIDf3, immunopurified total TFIID was reimmunoprecipitated with the anti-hTAF,130 mAb 2F4 (Jacq et al., 1994). The resulting TFIIDa and TFIIDI3 were sequentially probed with mAbs against hTAFI30 and TBP, as well as with mouse antisera raised against purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-hTAF,118 and GST-hTAF1128 (see Materials and methods). Both hTAF11 18 and hTAF1128 were detected along with hTAF1130 and TBP in the total immunopurified TFIID (Figure 3B, lanes 1 and 4). As described previously (Jacq et al., 1994), TBP could be detected in both TFIIDa and TFIID3, whereas hTAF1130 was almost exclusively present in TFIIDP (Figure 3B, lanes 2, 3, 5 and 6). Similar to TBP, hTAF11250 and hTAFII1OO (data not shown; Jacq et al., 1994), hTAF1128 was detected in both TFIIDax and TFIIDi (Figure 3B,  hTAFI30, respectively), total TFIID  lanes 4-6). In contrast, the hTAFI1 8 detected in total TFIID was clearly present in TFIID,, but only trace amounts were detected in TFIIDax (Figure 3B, compare lanes 1-3). As we have not yet raised antibodies against hTAF1120, its distribution in TFIIDa and cannot be determined. These results indicate that the isolated cDNAs for hTAF,128 and hTAFI, 18 encode bona fide TAF11s, which can be immunoprecipitated by antibodies against TBP and hTAF1130. Moreover, as suggested previously (Jacq et al., 1994), hTAF1128 is a core TAFI present in both TFIIDa and TFIID1, whereas hTAF,118 is a specific TAFI, preferentially associated with TFIIDI.  TAF- TAF and TAF- TBP interactions in vitro We investigated whether these novel hTAF11s interact with each other and also whether they interact with TBP, hTAF1130 or hTAF11250. The cDNAs encoding hTAFI1l 8, 20 and 28 were cloned into the pXJ series vectors (Xiao et al., 1991) and translated in vitro (Figure 4A).  1522  Cloning of human TAF11s A (1) M A  A DE E E D PT F EE E N  se;a iF El(TOTAL: 105 tor, 49- 5 c  B.

GST-hTAF1128, GST-hTAF11 18 and GST-TBP were expressed in Escherichia coli and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (see Materials and methods). Equivalent amounts of immobilized fusion proteins were incubated with 35S-labelled hTAF11s or TBP. Following extensive washing with buffer containing either 0.1 or 0.5 M  (Figure 4C, lanes 5 and 6, and D, lanes respectively). Furthermore, in contrast to the strong binding of hTAF,118 to GST -hTAF1128, only weak binding of hTAF1118 to GST-TBP was observed (Figure 4C and B, respectively, lanes 3 and 4). We also investigated possible interactions between the could be detected  3  and 4,  novel hTAF11s and the  hTAF1130 and hTAF11250 described  KCI  (see  Materials  and  methods),  the  bound  proteins were subjected to SDS -PAGE and detected by autoradiography. In vitro-translated hTAF1128 bound strongly to GSThTAFI11 18 after washing with both 0.1I and 0.5 M KCI (Figure 4D, lanes 5 and 6 respectively), and in the reciprocal experiment hTAF11 18 bound to GST-hTAF1128 (Figure 4C, lanes 3 and 4). As expected from previous results (Jupp et al., 1993; Kato et al., 1994), in vitrotranslated TBP bound to the GST-TBP beads (Figure 4B, lanes and beads  previously. Histidine (his)-tagged hTAF1130 was expressed in Ecoli, purified (Jacq et al., 1994) and incubated with GST -hTAF1128, GST -hTAF1120 and GST -hTAF,1l8. No interaction between GST-hTAF1128 and his-hTAF1130 could be detected (Figure 4F, lanes 8 and 10), whereas his-hTAF1130 bound to GST-hTAF111 8 (Figure 7F, lanes 1-3).

Furthermore, baculovirusexpressed hTAF11250 bound to GST-TBP (and as expected also to GST -hTAF,1135, the human homologue of  2).

These results confirm that hTAF1128 binds efficiently and directly to TBP and that hTAFI1 8 interacts more efficiently with hTAF1128 than with TBP. Moreover, in agreement with the results using the in vitro-translated hTAF,120, no binding of his-hTAF,118 or his-hTAF,128 to GSThTAF1120 was observed (data not shown). Taken together, these in vitro results indicate that hTAF,128, hTAF1120 and hTAF1118 interact with TBP with varying affinities. In addition, hTAF1128 interacts with hTAF,118 but not with hTAF1130, while both hTAF1118 and hTAF1120 interact with hTAFI30. No interactions between hTAF11250 and hTAF1128 or hTAFI 18 could be detected.  iQ ;,  'STT rAF: .,-.  ...... §+  d  !  \ :.

BlO hTAF1128  could be detected in extracts from cells transfected with the B 1 0-hTAF1128 expression vector but not Fig. 4. (A) In vitro translation of hTAF11s and TBP. The hTAF11s and TBP cloned in the pXJ series vectors were transcribed in vitro with T7 polymerase and translated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. A 1 1l aliquot of the reaction was separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. In lanes 1-4 each pair of lanes shows a duplicate reaction. M indicates the positions of the molecular mass markers. (B) Protein affinity chromatography with GST-TBP. Approximately 2 ,ug of GST-TBP were immobilized on 50 ,ul of glutathione-Sepharose, incubated with 2 gl of in vitro-translated TBP and hTAF11l8, 3 p1 of hTAF1120 and 6 gl of hTAF1128, and washed as described in Materials and methods. The bound TBP and hTAF11s were separated on gels containing 10 or 12% acrylamide, respectively. Odd-numbered lanes show the proteins retained on the beads after the wash with 0.1 M KCI; the evennumbered lanes show the proteins retained after the 0.5 M KCI wash. (C and D) TAF-TAF and TAF-TBP interactions in vitro. Protein affinity chromatography was performed as described in (B) using immobilized GST-hTAF1128 or GST-hTAF,118. (E) Baculovirus hTAF11250 binds to TBP and hTAF11135, but not to hTAF1128 or hTAF1118. Protein affinity chromatography was performed using extracts from Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus expressing hTAF11250 in the presence of [35S]methionine (a generous gift from J.Acker). The extract was first adsorbed on glutathione-Sepharose to remove nonspecific binding proteins. The flowthrough fraction was then incubated with the immobilized GST fusions. The resins were washed with buffer containing 0.5 M KCI and the bound proteins detected by autoradiography. (F) Protein affinity chromatography with purified hishTAF11s. Purified his-hTAF1130, his-hTAF1128 and his-hTAF,118 were incubated with an -20-fold excess of GST-TBP or GST-hTAF1128, washed with buffer containing 0.5 M KCI, and the bound proteins detected by immunoblotting using mAbs 4G2, 15TA and 16TA, to detect hTAF1130, 28 and 18, respectively. Lanes 1-6 and 7-10 were taken from different blots to avoid the detection of GST-hTAF1128 in lanes 7-8 with the 15TA antibody.  quantitation by SDS -PAGE and Coomassie blue staining, equal amounts of the purified proteins were incubated with a 20- to 30-fold excess of GST-TBP. Almost all of the his-hTAF,128 was retained on the GST-TBP beads, while only a fraction of the his-hTAF,118 was retained (Figure 4F, lanes 3-6). However, his-hTAF11 18 bound 1524  with the TBP expression vector, whereas the converse was observed for TBP (Figure 5A, lanes 1 and 4). Both TBP and B10-hTAFI128 were detected in extracts from cells cotransfected with the corresponding expression vectors (Figure 5A, lanes 7 and 13). The cell extracts were then immunoprecipitated with either mAb BlO or mAb 3G3. In the absence of cotransfected TBP, B10hTAF1128 was immunoprecipitated by mAb BlO, but not by mAb 3G3 (Figure 5A, lanes 2 and 3). Similarly, in the absence of cotransfected B10-hTAF1128, TBP was immunoprecipitated with mAb 3G3, but not with mAb B10 (Figure 5A, lanes 5 and 6). Clearly, however, when both proteins were coexpressed, TBP and B10-hTAF1128 could be coimmunoprecipitated by either of the two mAbs (Figure 5A, lanes 8, 9, 14 and 15). To determine whether the observed coprecipitation of B10-hTAFI128 and TBP resulted from an intracellular interaction, or whether the two proteins simply associated with one another after cell disruption, we mixed extracts from cells transfected with B10-hTAF1128 with extracts from cells transfected with TBP. In contrast to the efficient coimmunoprecipitation observed in the extracts from cotransfected cells (Figure 5A, lanes 8, 9, 14 and 15), almost no coimmunoprecipitation (Figure 5A, lanes 11 and 12) could be observed when the extracts of independently transfected cells were mixed together (Figure 5A, lane 10). Although this absence of coimmunoprecipitation may seem to contradict the results of the in vitro protein affinity chromatography experiments, it should be noted that in the in vitro experiments the GST fusion protein is present at high concentrations and is immobilized, whereas in the transfected cell extracts both proteins are in solution and are present in lower concentrations. Thus, the hTAF1128 TBP interactions observed in the above coimmunoprecipitations correspond to interactions occurring intra cellularly.  Cloning  of human TAFIs  interactions can be detected between hTAF1128 and TBP or hTAF11 18, but not with hTAF1130, and between hTAF11 18 and hTAF1130. ..........  .  .: .-w -  :..  up  41P  .0  Fig. 5. (A) Intracellular interaction between hTAF1128 and TBP. Aliquots of extracts from COS cells transfected with 5 ig of the expression vectors for B l0-hTAFI28 (lane 1) or TBP (lane 4), or simultaneously with both vectors (lanes 7 and 13), are shown. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with 1-2 gg of either the anti-tag mAb B 10 or the anti-TBP mAb 3G3, as indicated above each lane. The immunoprecipitated proteins were detected on Western blots with a mixture of mAbs 3G3 and B10, indicated below the panels. The positions of TBP, BI0-hTAF1128, the protein G released from the protein G-Sepharose upon boiling of the sample, and the heavy chain of the mAbs are indicated. In lanes 10-12 extracts from cells transfected with either hTAF1128 or TBP were mixed together, whereas in lanes 13-15 the expression vectors for each protein were cotransfected. (B) Distinct regions of hTAF1128 are required for intracellular interaction with TBP and hTAF1118. Cells were transfected with the expression vectors for the proteins indicated above each panel and the cell extracts were precipitated as described above with the mAbs indicated above each lane. The antibodies used to detect the precipitated proteins are indicated below each panel. The positions of TBP, native hTAF1118 and the BIO-hTAFI28 deletion mutants are indicated. In lanes 7-10 native hTAF118 was detected using the mouse antisera raised against GST-hTAF11l8 (see also Figure 3B).  hTAF,,20 interacts intracellularly with TBP, hTAF1,30 and hTAF,,28 A vector expressing B1O-hTAF1120 was also transfected into COS cells. Although this protein was expressed less efficiently than the other hTAF11s, TBP could be coprecipitated with B l0-hTAF120 (Figure 6D, lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, consistent with the in vitro results, hTAF1130 could also be coimmunoprecipitated with B10-hTAF1120 (Figure 6D, lanes 3 and 4). Conversely, coimmunoprecipitation of B 10-hTAF1120 with mAb 3G3 or 2F4 was also observed (data not shown). Interestingly, although no interaction between hTAF1120 and hTAF1128 could be observed in vitro (see above), hTAF1128 was coimmunoprecipitated with B10-hTAF1120 (Figure 6D, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, hTAF1120 appears to interact intracellularly not only with TBP and hTAF1130, but also with hTAF1128. Different regions of hTAF1,28 are required for interaction with TBP and hTAF1118 A series of C- or N-terminal deletions was created in hTAF1128 (Figure 7A) to determine the region(s) required for interactions with hTAF11 18 and TBP. The mutant proteins were expressed in E.coli as GST fusions, immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with in vitrotranslated TBP or hTAF11 18. TBP bound to wild-type GST-hTAF1128 as well as to the two N-terminal deletion mutants (Figure 7C, lanes 1-3). In contrast, only weak binding of TBP to the C-terminal deletion mutants was observed (Figure 7C, lanes 4 and 5). Similarly, in vitrotranslated hTAFI1 8 bound efficiently to wild-type GSThTAF1128 and to the two N-terminal deletion mutants, but not to the C-terminal deletion mutants (Figure 7D). Thus, a domain(s) located within or overlapping with the Cterminal moiety of hTAF1128 is required for binding in vitro to both hTAF11 18 and TBP. The hTAF1128 deletion mutants were also expressed as B 10-tagged proteins in COS cells to determine the region of hTAF1128 required for intracellular interaction with TBP. Following transfection into COS cells, the two Cterminal deletion mutants of hTAF1128 could be detected (Figure SB, lanes I and 4), and immunofluorescence indicated nuclear localization of these proteins (data not shown); however, no stable accumulation of the N-terminally deleted hTAF1128 mutants was detected (data not shown). In agreement with the in vitro data, TBP was coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type hTAF1128, but not with either of the C-terminally deleted hTAF1128 proteins (compare Figure 5A, lanes 8, 9, 14 and 15, with B, lanes 2, 3, 5 and 6). These results indicate that an interaction surface required for intracellular association with TBP is located within, or overlapping with, the C-terminal 61 amino acids of hTAF1128. The B 10-tagged C-terminal deletion mutants of hTAF1128 were also coexpressed with hTAFI1 18. In contrast to the results obtained in vitro, hTAF11 18 could be coimmunoprecipitated with B 10-hTAF128( 1-150), whereas no coimmunoprecipitation with B I0-hTAF1128(1-l 14) could be detected (Figure 5B, compare lanes 7 and 8 with 9 and 10). Thus, a domain located within or overlapping  A similar strategy was also used to detect intracellular interactions between hTAF1128 and hTAF1118. COS cells were cotransfected with vectors expressing B I 0-hTAFj1 18 and hTAF1128. hTAF1128 was detected on Western blots of transfected cell extracts using a monoclonal antibody (mAb 1 C9) raised against one of the tryptic peptides derived from hTAF1128 (see above and Materials and methods; Figure 6A, lane 1). In the absence of B1OhTAF11 18, hTAF1128 was not immunoprecipitated by mAb B 10 (Figure 6A, lane 2), whereas hTAF1128 was efficiently precipitated by mAb B 10 in the presence of cotransfected BI0-hTAF1118 (Figure 6A, lanes 3 and 4). The converse experiment could not be performed as mAb 1C9 did not immunoprecipitate hTAF1128 (data not shown). In contrast, and in agreement with the fact that we did not detect an interaction between hTAF1128 and hTAF1130 (see above), hTAF1130 and B 10-hTAF1128 did not coimmunoprecipitate from cotransfected cell extracts (Figure 6B, lanes 1-3). However, as expected, hTAF1130 was coimmunoprecipitated with B I 0-hTAF11 18 (Figure 6C), but no coprecipitation of BI0-hTAF1118 and TBP could be detected (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that intracellular  1525  G.Mengus et aL A. 1  .1 MA-  B p 9!.5  Li  IM A" :1  iwk4  .*  -.  :: 1  Lj  P..A D S..P, ;-. _. -_:  C. 13  D.

(F) In vitro interactions between hTAF1130, hTAF,118 and hTAF,120. Protein affinity chromatography was performed as described in the legend to Figure 4B except that 250 ng of purified histidine-tagged hTAF,130 were used rather than in vitro-translated protein. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed with buffer A containing 0.5 M KCI. Lanes 1 and 2 show the results obtained with the GST protein alone; lanes 3-6 show the results with wild-type and mutant derivatives of GST-hTAFI118; lanes 7 and 8 show the results with wild-type or a C-terminal mutant of GST-hTAF120. hTAF1130 was detected using mAb 4G2.  1526  Cloning of human TAFIs  with amino acids 114-150 of hTAF1128 is required for intracellular interaction with hTAF118. Furthermore, the differential binding of hTAFI1 8 and TBP to hTAF1128(1150) indicates that the domains of hTAF1128 responsible for these intracellular interactions are not identical.  hTAF,,28 and hTAF,,30 interact in vitro with distinct domains of hTAF1118 To determine the regions of hTAF1118 required for the interactions with hTAF,128 and hTAF1130 in vitro, a series of deletion mutants was generated (Figure 7B) and fused to GST. In vitro-translated hTAF1128 bound to wild-type GST-hTAFI1 8 and to the C-terminal deletion mutant (184) (Figure 7E, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, no binding to the N-terminal deletion mutant (39-124) or the double Nand C-terminal deletion mutant (39-84) was detected (Figure 7E, lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that a domain within or overlapping with the N-terminal 38 amino acids of hTAF1118 is required for interaction with hTAF1128 in vitro. E.coli-expressed his-hTAF1130 bound to the wild-type GST-hTAF1118, to the C-terminal deletion mutant and to the double C- and N-terminal deletion mutant (Figure 7F, lanes 3, 6 and 4, respectively). Surprisingly, however, no binding to the N-terminal deletion mutant (39-124) was detected (Figure 7F, lane 5). Nevertheless, amino acids 39-84 of hTAFI 18 sufficed to interact with hTAF1130, but not with hTAF1128 (compare Figure 7F, lane 4, with E, lane 4). Thus, distinct regions of hTAF11l8 are required for interaction with hTAF1130 and hTAF1128.  Discussion hTFIlDa and hTFIIDf3 have distinct hTAF, compositions We report here the cloning of cDNAs encoding three subunits of hTFIID. hTAF1128 is the homologue of the previously characterized dTAF1130P3, while hTAF1120 is the homologue of p22. In Drosophila, p22 is an alternatively spliced form of dTAF130oa (Kokubo et al., 1994). However, none of the hTAF1120 cDNAs from HeLa cells isolated in this study encoded a protein analogous to dTAF,130x. The detection of a human homologue of fulllength dTAF1,30x and the determination of its abundance and distribution in different human cell lines will be facilitated by the development of antibodies against hTAF1120. The amino acid sequence of hTAFII 18 shows homology to the N-terminal region of the yeast TAFI, SPT3 (Eisenmann et al., 1992, and references therein). A more extensive homology between hTAF11 18 and the yeast protein FUN 81 (Dubois et al., 1987) was observed, suggesting that this protein may also be a yeast TAFI. Recently, other yeast TAF11s with homology to d(h)TAF11250 and dTAF1180 have been reported (Reese et al., 1994). However, no homologue of hTAF1118 has been described in Drosophila as yet. This result, together with the fact that no Drosophila homologue of hTAF1130 has been identified, supports the idea that hTFIID may comprise more TAF11s than dTFIID. Nevertheless, one cannot exclude the existence of Drosophila counterparts for these hTAFIs as such counterparts may correspond to cell-specific dTAF11s expressed in Drosophila adult tissues.  We showed previously that hTFIID complexes could be separated into two species, hTFIIDa and hTFIIDP, either lacking or containing hTAF1130 (Jacq et al., 1994). These two species appeared to comprise both core and specific hTAF11s. From these results we proposed that hTAF1128 would be a core hTAF11, but that hTAF,118 and hTAF1120 would be specifically associated with TFIIDP. However, we could not formally demonstrate that the 28 kDa subunits detected in both TFIIDa and TFIID3 were in fact the same protein rather than two distinct proteins with analogous electrophoretic mobilities. Using antibodies against recombinant hTAF1128, we show here that hTAF1128 is indeed a core TAFI present in both TFIIDa and TFIIDI3. Thus, we conclude from this and our previous study (Jacq et al., 1994) that hTAF11250, hTAFII1OO and hTAF1128 are core hTAF11s common to both TFIIDax and TFIIDf. In contrast to hTAF1128, we show that hTAF11 18 is preferentially, if not exclusively, associated with TFIID3, confirming our previous proposal that hTAF11 18 is a TFIID3-specific hTAFI1 (Jacq et al., 1994). These results show clearly that TFIIDa and TFIID, have distinct hTAFI1 compositions, as they differ not only by the presence or absence of hTAF1130, but also by that of hTAFI 18. Antibodies directed against recombinant hTAF1120 will be required to demonstrate that the isolated hTAF1120 cDNA, characterized here, encodes the 20 kDa TFIID subunit which we have proposed to be a TFIID3-specific TAFI1 (Jacq et al., 1994). hTAF1I 18 interacts directly with TBP but interacts more strongly with hTAF1130 and hTAF1128, both of which also interact directly with TBP (summarized in Figure 8A and B). As hTAF1118 interacts with hTAF1128 and hTAF1130 it is conceivable that it would be recruited more stably to TFIID,B containing both hTAF1128 and hTAF1130, in agreement with the observation that hTAFI, 18 is a TFIIDP3specific TAFII. Similarly, hTAF1130 may be more stably associated with TFIIDP due to interactions with both TBP and hTAF1118. Alternatively, the TFIIDP-specific hTAF11s, hTAF1130, hTAFI 18 and hTAF1120, may interact to preform a ternary complex, which is then recruited by interactions with the core hTAF11s and TBP to form TFIIDP. Reconstitution experiments will be required to test these possibilities.  TAF- TAF and TAF- TBP interactions in hTFIID In this study we have identified a series of in vitro and intracellular interactions amongst the novel hTAF11s, and between the novel hTAF11s and hTAF1130 or TBP. We have shown that hTAF,128 and hTAF1120 interact with TBP both in vitro and intracellularly following transient cotransfection. It is important to note that the intracellular interactions detected in the cotransfection experiments do not result from the incorporation of the transfected hTAF11s or TBP into the endogenous COS cell TFIID. This is clearly indicated by the absence of coprecipitation of transfected hTAF1128 and hTAF1130, despite the fact that these proteins are associated in TFIID,B. Similarly, no coprecipitation of the endogenous COS cell TBP and transfected hTAF11s was observed. Moreover, when extracts from cells cotransfected with TBP and hTAFI28 were precipitated with an anti-TBP mAb, no hTAFIs other  1527  G.Mengus et al  A .1  .9  .dciTB3Pt 4 \- * dKo  ..  0  13,  ..

The TAF-TAF and TAF-TBP interactions deduced from this and previous studies are summarized. hTAF11250, hTAF1130, hTAF1128, hTAF1120 and hTAF1118 interact with TBP. hTAF11250 interacts with hTAF11135 and hTAF1130. In addition, hTAF1130 also contacts hTAF1120 and hTAF1118. hTAF1128 interacts with hTAF11I8 and hTAF1120 and, in addition, hTAF1120 contacts hTAF1130 and hTAF,1135. Note that the hTAFIs are shown to contact TBP simultaneously, but this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Alternatively, TFIID complexes may be formed by several different pathways.  than hTAF1128 could be detected by either immunoblotting or silver nitrate staining (our unpublished data). Our results and those from other laboratories show clearly that, contrary to initial reports (Hisatake et al., 1993; Kokubo et al., 1993a; Zhou et al., 1993), TAF11250 is not the only TAFI to interact directly with TBP. In dTFIID, dTAF11250, dTAF,130a and dTAF1150 have all been shown to interact directly with dTBP. For dTAF1140 (p42), dTAF1160 (p62) and dTAF1180 (p85) contradictory results concerning their ability to bind to dTBP have been obtained (Goodrich et al., 1993; Weinzierl et al., 1993a; Chen et al., 1994; Kokubo et al., 1994). In hTFIID, hTAF11250, hTAF1130, hTAF1128, hTAF1120 and hTAF118  have been shown to interact with hTBP (Figure 8A and B). In addition, Zhou et al. (1993) reported that an as yet uncharacterized hTAF11125 also interacted with TBP in far Western blotting experiments, although it is not known whether hTAFI 125 is a homologue of dTAFI1 150 or simply a degradation product of hTAF11250. It will be interesting to determine with which regions of TBP each of these TAF11s interacts, and whether they can all interact simultaneously with TBP or whether some of these interactions are mutually exclusive. Recently it has been shown that the binding of dTAF11250 and dTAFI1 150 to TBP prevented the subsequent interaction with the hTAFjs and vice versa (Comai et al., 1994). It is possible that there may also be a competition between the hTAF11s for binding to TBP, suggesting that hTFIID complexes may be assembled by more than one pathway. In addition to TBP, hTAF1128 also interacts with hTAF1118 (Figure 8A and B). Deletion analysis indicated that the C-terminal region of hTAF1128 (amino acids 109211) bound TBP, and that deletion of the C-terminal 61 amino acids abolished binding to TBP. These results indicate that a region within or overlapping with the Cterminal 61 amino acids of hTAF1128 contains an interaction surface required for binding to TBP. The C-terminal amino acids 109-211 of hTAF1128 also bound in vitro to hTAF1118, and no binding of hTAF1118 to the two C-terminal deletion mutants was observed in vitro. However, in transfected cells hTAFI,1 8 interacted with the C-terminal deletion mutant (1-150) but not with mutant (1-114), whereas neither of these mutants bound TBP. The differential binding of hTAFI11 8 and TBP to mutant (1-150) in the same intracellular assay indicates that these two proteins bind, at least in part, to distinct regions of hTAF1128. Note that there is a difference in the ability of hTAF1118 to bind to the C-terminal deletion 1150 in vitro and intracellularly. We have observed another discrepancy between the intracellular and in vitro results as no in vitro binding between hTAF1120 and hTAF1128 was observed, but these two hTAF11s were coprecipitated from cotransfected cells. Some of these observations may be explained by the bacterially produced GST fusion proteins adopting conformations which artefactually mask potential interaction surfaces. Alternatively, intracellular post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may be required to allow interaction between hTAF1128 and hTAF1120. In this respect we note that many hTAF11s have been shown to be phosphorylated (Boyer and Berk, 1993). Furthermore, although the intracellular TAF-TAF interactions described here do not result from the incorporation of the transfected hTAF11s into TFIID complexes, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of these interactions may be mediated by unknown bridging proteins. In view of such observations, negative results in in vitro assays should not be taken as definitive proof of a lack of interaction between two proteins. hTAFI1 18 interacts with hTAF1130 and hTAF1128 (Figure 8A and B). Deletion analysis indicates that the N-terminal 38 amino acids of hTAFI11 8 are required for interaction with hTAF1128. Furthermore, although no binding of hTAF1130 to the N-terminal deletion mutant (39-124) was observed (possibly due to artefactual folding of the bacterially expressed protein; discussed above), amino acids 39-84 sufficed to interact with hTAF1130. Thus, in  1528  Cloning of human TAFIs  the same in vitro assay, mutant (39-84) had a differential ability to bind hTAF1130 and hTAF1128, indicating that distinct domains within hTAF1118 are required for interactions with these two hTAF11s. Analogous experiments were not performed in transient transfection assays as the B 10-tagged hTAFI1 18 deletion mutants did not accumulate in transfected cells (our unpublished data).  Comparison of TAF- TAF and TAF- TBP interactions in hTFIID and dTFIID Comparison of the results of our present and previous hTFIID studies (Jacq et al., 1994) with those concerning dTFIID reveals a number of similarities and differences in the organization of TFIID complexes in Drosophila embryos and human HeLa cells (summarized in Figure 8A). As discussed above, the major difference is the existence in HeLa cell TFIID of two hTAF11s with no known Drosophila homologues. Nevertheless, major differences exist even for homologous TAF11s. The most striking of these concerns hTAF1128 which interacts with hTBP but not hTAF11250, whereas its Drosophila homologue interacts with dTAF11250 but not dTBP (Yokomori et al., 1993b; Chen et al., 1994; see Figure 8A). On the other hand, and in agreement with the results obtained with p22 and dTAF1130a (Yokomori et al., 1993b; Kokubo et al., 1994), hTAF1120 interacts directly with TBP and with hTAFI 135, the human homologue of dTAFl 1I0 (Hoey et al., 1993; Yokomori et al., 1993b; our unpublished data; summarized in Figure 8A and B). However, in addition to binding to TBP and hTAF11135, we also detected additional interactions between hTAF1120 and hTAF1128 or hTAF1130. The in vitro experiments further suggest that hTAF1130 and TBP (data not shown) interact with hTAF1120 via the C-terminal moiety of hTAF1120. This region is highly conserved between the Drosophila and human proteins, and sequences within this region of dTAF,130c have been shown to be required for binding to dTAF1I 110 and multimerization of dTAF130a (Yokomori et al., 1993b). A detailed analysis of hTAF1120 will be required to precisely determine the domains required for each of these interactions. In any event it is clear that hTFIID differs from dTFIID, as it is known at present, in a number of respects; hTFIID comprises more TAF11s than dTFIID and these hTAF11s assemble into two hTFIID species (x and P), and differing TAF-TAF and TAF-TBP interactions can be observed in hTFIID and dTFIID. Although this study gives some new insights into the organization of hTFIID, the function of the novel hTAF11s described here is as yet unknown. It has been suggested previously (Yokomori et al., 1993b) that dTAF,130a and X could act to stabilize contacts between the other TFIID subunits. This may also be the function of hTAF1120 as this hTAFI, contacts many other TFIID subunits. These observations, however, do not rule out the possibility that these small hTAF11s may also make contacts with transcriptional activators, as observed with hTAF,130 (Jacq et al., 1994), and play a direct role in the transactivation process. Experiments to test these possibilities are currently in progress.  immunopurified using the mAbs 2C1 or 3G3, and the TFIID eluted from the protein G-Sepharose using an excess of synthetic peptide comprising the corresponding epitope. The eluted TFIID was dialysed against buffer containing 5 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.9), 5 jiM DTT and 0.01% SDS for 6-8 h. The TFIID was then lyophilized and resolved by SDS -PAGE. The proteins were electroblotted overnight in 50 mM Tris and 50 mM boric acid onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Immobilon P, 0.45 ,uM) and stained briefly with Coomassie blue. The hTAFJ1s were excised and digested in situ on the membrane with trypsin. The eluted peptides were then separated by reverse-phase HPLC and microsequenced. For hTAF1128, two peptides were obtained: MQILVSSFSEEQLNR and LIQSITGTSVSQNVVIAM. Based on these sequences two degenerate oligonucleotides were synthetized: 5'-ATGCAA/GATC/TC/TflGTG/C/ TT/AC/GIT/AC/GITTC/TT/AC/GIGAA/GGAA/GCAA/GC/TTIAAC/T C/AG-3' and 5'-C/TTG/C/TATC/TCAA/GA/TC/GIATC/TACA/C/TG GA/G/C/TACA/C/TA/TC/GIGTC/GA/TC/GICAA/GAAC/TGTC/GGTC/GATC/TGCA/C/TATG-3'.  They were used to screen a random-primed HeLa cell cDNA library in X ZAPII (Stratagene). 6x 105 clones were screened by hybridization with the 32P 5' end-labelled oligonucleotides in 6x SSC at 42°C overnight. The filters were washed in 6x SSC at 45 or 50°C and subjected to autoradiography. Three clones which hybridized with both oligonucleotides were purified and in vivo excision was performed. The cDNA inserts were completely sequenced with internal primers using an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer. The resulting data were analysed and database searching was performed using the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software (University of Wisconsin, WI) sequence analysis programmes. For hTAF1120, four peptides were obtained: DVQLHLER, QWNMWIPGFGSEEIR, LSPENNQVLTK and MALIR. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the first two sequences were synthetized and used to screen the HeLa library (5'-GAC/TGTC/T/GCAA/GC/TTICAC/TCtTTIGAA/ GC/AG-3' and 5'-CAA/GTGGAAC/TATGTGGGATC/TCCA/C/TGGITTC/TGGIA/TGCIGAA/GGAA/GATC/TC/AG-3'). The resulting clones were analysed as described above. For hTAFI,1 8, two peptides were obtained: VQVEDIVFLIRK and ARKAFDEANYGS. The corresponding oligonucleotides were synthetized: 5'-GTC/G/TCAA/GGTC/G/TGAA/GGAC/TATC/TGTC/G/TTT-3' and 5'-AAA/GGCA/C/CC/TGAC/TGAA/GGCA/C/TAAC/TTAC/ TGG-3'.  Construction of expression vectors The coding sequences of hTAF,128 and hTAFIl 8 and the corresponding deletion mutants were amplified by the PCR using appropriate primers with in-frame BamHI and EcoRI sites. They were cloned into the corresponding sites in the pGEX2T vector. GST-hTAF1120 WT and 1-71 were constructed by PCR amplifying the appropriate regions of the hTAF1120 coding sequence with oligonucleotide primers containing in-frame EcoRI sites and cloning into the EcoRI site of pGEX2T. GST-hTAF11135 was constructed by inserting a BglII-EcoRI fragment encoding the C-terminal 602 amino acids into pGEX3X. GST-TBP has been described previously (Jacq et al., 1994). pXJ42-hTAF1128, pXJ41-hTAF1120 and pXJ41-hTAF1118 were constructed by PCR amplifying the corresponding coding sequences with EcoRI and BamHI sites (or XhoI and EcoRI for hTAF,120) and cloning into the pXJ expression vectors described previously (Xiao et al., 1991). The PCR primer oligonucleotides were designed to introduce a consensus Kozak sequence. pXJ41 -hTAF1130 and pXJ40-TBP were as described previously (Jacq et al., 1994). Histidine-tagged hTAF1128 and hTAF1118 were constructed by PCR using oligonucleotide primers containing NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The resulting fragments were cloned between the appropriate sites in pET15. The B 10 epitope-tagged hTAF128, hTAF1120 and hTAF11l 18 were constructed by PCR amplifying the corresponding coding sequences with in-frame NheI sites and cloning into a modified pAT6 expression vector (Tribouley et al., 1994). The DNA sequences of all plasmids were verified by automated DNA sequencing.  Materials and methods Purification of TFIID complexes and cloning of hTAF,-s Nuclear extracts were prepared and purified on heparin-ultrogel as described (Brou et al., 1993a; Chaudhary et al., 1994). The TFIID was  Immunization, mAb production, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting Immunizations and mAb production were performed as described previously (Brou et al., 1993a; Lescure et al., 1994). Mice were injected intraperitoneally three times at 2 week intervals with 100 jg of the hTAF1128 peptide MQILVSSFSEEQLNR coupled to ovalbumin. Spleen cells were fused with Sp2/O AG 14 myeloma cells; culture supernatants at day 10 were tested on COS cells transfected with pXJ42-hTAF128 by immunostaining or ELISA. These injections generated mAb IC9.  1529  G.Mengus et al. Mice were also injected three times at 2 week intervals with 200 ,ug purified GST-hTAF1128 or GST-hTAF118 and the immunoblots in Figure 3 were performed with the resulting mouse serum. After fusions, two mAbs were obtained: 15TA against hTAF1128 and 16TA against hTAF1118. These mAbs were used for the immunoblots shown in Figure 4F. The anti-TBP antibodies 3G3 and 2C1 and the anti-hTAF130 antibodies 4G2 and 2F4 were purified by caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate precipitation as described previously (Brou et al., 1993a). mAb B 10 was as described previously (Ali et al., 1993). The preparative immunopurification of TFIID complexes was essentially as described previously (Jacq et al., 1994). 250 ml of the H 0.6 M KCI fraction (-500 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with -300 jig of mAbs 3G3 or 2C1 using I ml of protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4°C. The resin was then washed extensively five times with 50 ml of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 0.2% NP-40) containing 1.0 M KCI and the TFIID eluted by the addition of an excess of the corresponding epitope peptide. Transfected cell extracts were precipitated with 1-2 jg of mAbs B 10, 3G3 or 2F4, and 30-40 jl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4°C. The resin was then washed four times for 10 min at 20°C with I ml buffer A containing 1.0 M KCI. The resin was then boiled in SDS loading buffer and the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE.

Biol., 14, 3927-3937.  In vitro transcription and translation In vitro transcription and translation were performed as described previously (Hwang et al., 1993). Plasmids were linearized at appropriate restriction sites and 2 jg were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. 100-500 ng of the resulting RNA were translated in the presence of [35S]methionine in 35 jil of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in a final volume of 50 jil. A 1 jil aliquot of the translation products was separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed with 100% acetic acid and then treated with 10% 2-5 diphenyloxazole (PPO) in acetic acid. The gels were then washed with water, dried and subjected to autoradiography.  Protein affinity chromatography E.coli cells harbouring the GST-TAF (TBP) fusion vectors were induced for 2-3 h at 37°C with I mM IPTG. The cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A containing 500 mM KCI; the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25 000 r.p.m. for 20 min. 100 jil-1 ml of the extracts were then incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 50 jil of glutathione - Sepharose beads. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with I ml of buffer A containing 1.0 M KCI. The bound protein was detected by staining with Coomassie blue following SDS-PAGE. The amounts of cell extracts required to immobilize 1-2 jig of each GST fusion protein were then determined. Alternatively, the fusion proteins used for immunization of mice were eluted from the beads using buffer A containing 10 mM reduced glutathione. For protein affinity chromatography, the immobilized GST fusion proteins were washed as described above and incubated with either the in vitrotranslated proteins or purified his-TAFj1s in a 100 jil volume for 2 h at 4°C with nutation. The beads were then washed four times for 10 min at 20°C with I ml of buffer A containing 0.1 M KCI. Half of the beads were then removed and added to 30 gl SDS loading buffer. The remaining beads were then washed three times with I ml buffer A containing 0.5 M KCI prior to SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed and dried as described above and subjected to autoradiography. His-tagged hTAF1Js were expressed and purified as described previously (Jacq et al., 1994). Following binding experiments, the his-TAF11s were detected by immunoblotting using the appropriate mAbs.  Transient transfections and cell extracts COS cells were transfected with 2-10 jig of the pAT6 or pXJ40 series expression vectors by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. 48 h after transfection the cells were washed with PBS and harvested. Cells from a 1 X90 mm plate were lysed by the addition of 100 ji of buffer A containing 0.5 M KCI, followed by three rounds of freezing and thawing. 50 jil of the cell extracts were then used in the immunoprecipitations.

																										<Abstract>RB, the protein product of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, regulates the activity of specific transcription factors. This regulation appears to be mediated either directly through interactions with specific transcription factors or through an alternative mechanism. Here we report that stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB is partially abrogated at the nonpermissive temperature in ts13 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250, first identified as the cell cycle regulatory protein CCG1. The stimulation of Sp1-mediated transcription by RB in ts13 cells at the nonpermissive temperature could be restored by the introduction of wild-type human TAFII250. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RB binds directly to hTAFII250 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that RB can confer transcriptional regulation and possibly cell cycle control and tumor suppression through an interaction with TFIID, in particular with TAFII250.</Abstract>

ZUKERBERG,1,2 CHIDI NGWU,1 ED HARLOW,1 AND JACQUELINE A.

This transcriptional activity is inhibited by association with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) or its relatives p107 and p130. The first cDNA from the E2F family to be cloned was designated E2F-1, and multiple E2F family members have now been identified. They bind to DNA as heterodimers, interacting with proteins known as DP. Here we demonstrate that DP is also a family of polypeptides with at least two members (hDP-1 and hDP-2). Both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all E2F family members in vivo, and each complex is capable of activating transcription. However, the various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107 in vivo, and the specificity of pRB or p107 binding is mediated by the E2F subunit. E2F was initially identified as a mammalian DNA-binding protein that was required for activation of the adenovirus E2 promoter (46). E2F-mediated transactivation is normally inhibited by association with negative regulators such as the retinoblastoma protein (pRB). During viral infection, E2Fdependent transcription is induced by expression of the viral E1A protein (8, 47). Recent studies have shown that E1Amediated transactivation is dependent on the ability of E1A to bind to pRB, p107, or p130, releasing free E2F and stimulating transcription (2, 6, 11, 13, 17, 30, 32, 48). The first E2F-associated protein identified was pRB, the product of a tumor suppressor gene that is commonly mutated in human tumors. The association of pRB and E2F does not appear to alter the affinity of E2F for DNA but is sufficient to inhibit its transcriptional activity (23, 27, 31, 52). pRB is phosphorylated by one or more of the cyclin-dependent kinases (26, 37, 40, 42­44). This phosphorylation is thought to be sufficient to change pRB such that it is no longer able to bind to E2F (10, 23, 28). This release of free E2F results in transcriptional activation. Thus, the loss of functional pRB through mutation, the expression of E1A, and phosphorylation of pRB all result in activation of E2F. In addition to pRB, the activity of E2F is also regulated by its association with several other cellular proteins. These include the pRB-related proteins p107 and p130. The interaction of these proteins with E2F is more complicated, as the interactions also include stoichiometric levels of certain cyclin-dependent kinases. Independent complexes with cyclin A/cdk2 and cyclin E/cdk2 have previously been identified (6, 9, 13, 14, 39, 45, 51). The binding of these kinases to E2F is indirect and is mediated by virtue of their stable association with p130 and p107 (9, 13). As with pRB, the timing of these interactions is also tightly regulated. The p130/E2F complex appears predominately in cells that either are arrested in G0 or are reentering the cell cycle from an arrested state (13). Initially this complex * Corresponding author.

Similarly, formation of E2F/p107/cyclin E/cdk2 and E2F/p107/cyclin A/cdk2 appears to coincide with the formation and activation of each of these kinase complexes (14, 39, 45, 49, 51). In normal cells, E2F acts to regulate the transcription of a large number of genes whose products appear to play an essential role in regulating passage through the cell cycle (46). Moreover, their expression appears to be linked to the stages of the cell cycle in which the products of these genes function. The proteins that interact with E2F are thought to function in concert to restrict the activation of E2F and therefore E2Fresponsive genes to these distinct cell cycle stages. In the last 2 years, six genes that encode components of E2F (E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3, E2F-4, E2F-5, and DP-1) have been cloned (7, 19, 21, 28, 35, 36, 41, 48a, 50, 51a, 53). The first, called E2F-1, was cloned by virtue of its ability to interact with pRB (28, 36, 50). Transfection of E2F-1 is able to activate transcription in a manner that is dependent on the presence of E2F binding sites (28, 36). Subsequently, four additional cDNA clones that are highly homologous to E2F-1 were identified (7, 19, 35, 41, 48a, 52a). The encoded proteins, E2F-2, E2F-3, E2F-4, and E2F-5, have properties similar to those of E2F-1, suggesting that E2F activity might result from the concerted activity of a family of closely related proteins (7, 19, 35, 41, 48a, 52a). In independent studies, Girling and colleagues were able to purify and clone an E2F-like activity from mouse embryonal F9 cells (21). The cDNA isolated, DP-1, shares limited homology with E2F-1, E2F-2, or E2F-3 except for in a small region that corresponds to the DNA binding domain of each of these three proteins (21). DP-1 itself has little or no affinity for DNA (29). However, recently a number of groups have shown that E2F-1 and DP-1 can heterodimerize (4, 29, 38). Moreover, this dimerization appears to be essential for both high-affinity DNA binding and efficient transcriptional activation (4, 29, 38). This finding suggests that functional E2F might contain both E2F and DP subunits. To keep the nomenclature of these proteins clear in this report, we have called the individual polypeptides in the heterodimer by the name of the cloned cDNA, followed by the number that describes the order of  VOL. 15, 1995  E2F AND DP FAMILY PROTEINS  2537  their identification (E2F-1, E2F-2, etc., or hDP-1 or hDP-2). The general activity and the complex will be referred to as E2F without a number designation. To characterize the nature of E2F, we have begun to examine how these proteins interact. We have been able to demonstrate that there is a family of DP proteins, both hDP-1 and hDP-2 bind to all the various E2F subunits, and each can serve as a potent transactivator. However, various E2F/DP complexes display strong differences in the ability to bind to either pRB or p107, and this specificity appears to be mediated by the E2F subunit. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning of hDP-2 cDNA. A cDNA probe, encoding codons 84 to 204 of mouse DP-1, was used to screen 1 million plaques from a cDNA library (in lambda ZAPII) prepared from the human pre-B-cell line Nalm 6. Hybridization was carried at 42C in 5X SSC (1X SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate)­5X Denhardt's solution­30% formamide­5% dextran sulfate, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)­150 mug of denatured salmon sperm DNA per ml. Filters were washed three times at room temperature for 20 min in 2X SSC­ 0.1% SDS. Positive clones were detected by autoradiography and plaque purified. Novel clones were sequenced by using Sequenase 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical) as suggested by the manufacturer. Plasmid constructions. All cytomegalovirus (CMV) expression plasmids were constructed in pCMV-Neo-Bam (3). pCMV-E2F-1 (1-437), pCMV-E2F-1 (89437), pCMV-E2F-2 (85-437), pCMV-E2F-3 (132-425), pCMV-HA-hDP-1 (1410), pCMV-RB, pCMV-RBDelta22, and pCMV-p107 have been described previously (29, 41, 54). pCMV-E2F-2 (1-437) was a kind gift of M. Ivey-Hoyle. pCMV-HA-hDP-2 (1-385) was generated by two steps of cloning. The complete open reading frame (385 codons) of hDP-2 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI site in pBSK-HA (29). This region was then isolated from pBSK-HA-hDP-2 as a HincII-XbaI fragment, blunt ended with DNA polymerase large fragment (Klenow), and then subcloned into the blunted BamHI site of pCMV-Neo-Bam. The nucleotide sequence of the hDP-2 open reading frame was then confirmed. pQE-hDP-1 was constructed by isolating the BamHI fragment containing hDP-1 (1-410) from pGST-hDP-1 (29) and inserted into pQE8 (Qiagen). pQE-hDP-2 (1-291) was constructed by isolating a fragment of hDP-2 cDNA encoding amino acids 1 to 291 from pBSK-HA-hDP-2 and inserted into pQE9 (Qiagen). Northern (RNA) blots. Total cellular RNA were isolated from 293 (adenovirus-transformed primary embryonal kidney), HT230 (colon adenocarcinoma), IMR32 (neuroblastoma), CEM (T-lymphoblastoid leukemia), ML-1 (premyeloid leukemia), MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), SIHA (cervical squamous carcinoma), NGP (neuroblastoma), C33-A (cervical carcinoma), and HL60 (premyelocytic leukemia) cells by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (12). RNAs from the first seven listed cell lines were generously provided by K. Helin. Total cellular RNA (30 mug) was electrophoresed on 1% formamide agarose gels. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and approximately equal amounts of rRNA were observed (data not shown). The RNA was then transferred onto Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham). Each lane of the human tissue blot (Clontech Laboratory, Inc.) contains 2 mug of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the indicated human tissues. For this blot, the levels of actin message have been quantitated in previous studies (41). The blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled PCR fragments containing either codons 342 to 410 of hDP-1 or codons 291 to 385 of hDP-2. In each case, the blots were then stripped and reprobed with PCR fragments encoding either the DNA binding domain of hDP-1 (codon 84 to 204) or the 5' end of hDP-2 (codons 1 to 78). The specificity of these probes was confirmed by Southern blotting of the cDNA clones, and the hDP-1 and hDP-2 expression patterns were consistent, regardless of the region from which the probe was prepared. Hybridization was performed at 42C for 18 h in 5X SSPE (1X SSPE is 0.18 M NaCl, 10 mM NaH2 PO4, and 1 mM EDTA [pH 7.7])­10X Denhardt's solution­50% formamide­2% SDS­100 mug of denatured salmon sperm DNA per ml. The filters were washed twice at room temperature for 30 min in 2X SSC­ 0.1% SDS and then twice at 65C in 0.1X SSC­0.1% SDS. Antibodies. The recombinant polyhistidine­hDP-1 (1-410) protein encoded by pQE-hDP-1 and polyhistidine­hDP-2 (1-291) protein encoded by pQE-hDP-2 (1-291) were produced in Escherichia coli and purified through a nickel column under denaturing conditions as recommended by the manufacturer. The purified proteins were used to immunize BALB/c mice. To prepare monoclonal antibodies against hDP-1, splenocytes from a mouse immunized with polyhistidine­hDP-1 (1-410) protein were fused to Sp2 myeloma cells 4 days after final boost. Positive tissue culture supernatants were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays against glutathione S-transferase (GST)­hDP-1 (1-410) protein. Positive clones were further tested for immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled hDP-1 protein synthesized in vitro, in E2F gel shift assays, and in Western blot (immunoblot) analyses. Eight cell lines (WTH1, -2, -3, -5, -6, -10, -16, and -24) were generated by single-cell cloning. All  eight hDP-1 monoclonal antibodies are of the immunoglobulin G1 subclass and are specific in detecting hDP-1 in Western blot assays. Three of the eight monoclonal antibodies (WTH3, -16, and -24) recognize epitopes in the 1­204 region of hDP-1 and could specifically immunoprecipitate hDP-1 protein (data not shown). Four monoclonal antibodies (WTH1, -2, -5, and -10) recognize epitopes in the 204­410 region and are specific in supershifting hDP-1 in E2F gel shift assays (Fig. 6B). Monoclonal antibodies against E2F-1 (KH20), pRB (XZ77), p107 (SD2, -4, -6, -9 and -15), simian virus 40 T antigen (Pab416 and Pab419), and hemagglutinin tag (12CA5) have been described previously (16, 18, 24, 29, 34). Mouse antisera raised against GST­hDP-1 (1-204), GST­E2F-2 (85-200), and GST­E2F-3 (132230) fusion proteins have been described previously (29, 41). Transient transfection. C33-A, a human cervical carcinoma cell line, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were carried out as described previously (1, 22). For the gel shift assays, 90-mm-diameter dishes were transfected with 10 mug each of the E2F and DP expression plasmids and 10 mug of carrier DNA. For the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays, cells were transfected with 4 mug of E2F4-BCAT, 3 mug of pRSVluciferase, 13 mug of carrier DNA, the indicated amount of CMV expression plasmid, and pCMV-neo-Bam to give a total of 20.3 mug of DNA (29). Cells were harvested 24 to 36 h after transfection. CAT assays were performed as described previously (29, 41). Gel shift assays. Whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously (29). Five micrograms of protein was incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; pH 7.4)­40 mM KCl­1 mM MgCl2­0.5 mM EDTA­0.25% Nonidet P-40­5% glycerol­2 mug of denatured salmon sperm DNA. After addition of 0.1 ng of the 32 P-labeled E2F probe (ATTTAAGTTTCGCGCCCTTTCCAA), each reaction mixture was incubated for a further 15 min at room temperature. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel at a constant 180 V at 4C for 2.25 h in 0.25X Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. The gel was then dried and visualized by autoradiography. To detect the presence of a specific protein, 1 mul of monoclonal tissue culture supernatant or polyclonal antiserum was added to the DNA binding reaction mixture prior to the addition of the proteins. To demonstrate the specificity of DNA binding, a 100-fold of excess of either wild-type (see above) or mutant (ATTTAAGTTTCGatCCCTTTCTCAA) E2F binding site was included in the binding reaction mixture. To prepare for immunoprecipitation-deoxycholate-released proteins, 250 mug of ML-1 cell extract was incubated with 200 mul of monoclonal tissue culture supernatant in 1X DNA binding buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 40 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol). The antibody was precipitated by protein A-Sepharose and washed three times with 1X DNA binding buffer, and the associated proteins were released by the addition of 0.8% deoxycholate in 1X DNA binding buffer. Nonidet P-40 was added to give a final concentration of 1.5%, and the released proteins were tested in the DNA binding assay described above. To prepare the DP-1-depleted extract, hDP-1 monoclonal antibodies (WTH16 and WTH24) and control monoclonal antibody Pab419 were coupled to protein G-Sepharose (25). ML-1 cell lysate (600 mug of proteins) was incubated for 1 h with either 200 mul of 10% protein G-Sepharose coupled with WTH16 and WTH24 or with same amount protein G-Sepharose coupled with Pab419. After a brief spin, the supernatants were used in gel shift assays. Nucleotide sequence accession number. The accession number of the human DP-2 sequence is L40386.  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  RESULTS Isolation of hDP-2 cDNA. The mouse DP-1 cDNA was isolated originally by Girling and colleagues (21). To isolate human homologs of DP-1, we screened a cDNA library prepared from the human pre-B-cell line Nalm 6 with a probe encoding the putative DNA binding domain of the mouse DP-1 protein. After hybridization and washing under low-stringency conditions, we identified five independent positive clones. The majority of these clones encoded human DP-1, as described previously (29). However, using this strategy, we also isolated an additional DP-1-related cDNA clone. This cDNA clone contained 1,266 nucleotides and encoded a 385-amino-acid protein with 67% identity with the human DP-1 protein (Fig. 1). This homology is highest in the region of DP-1 that contains the DNA binding and E2F dimerization domains. In addition, it extends downstream of these domains into a portion of hDP-1 whose function is unknown. Finally, although there is little sequence homology in this region, the C-terminal portions of hDP-1 and hDP-2 are unusually acidic in nature (13 and 11 acidic amino acids, respectively, out of the last 16  2538  WU ET AL.

We have compared the sequence of our hDP-2 cDNA clone with those contained in the Genome Sequence database. In addition to the mouse and human DP-1 clones, this search identified one other sequence that had been cloned previously as an mRNA expressed in human heart (accession number Z17843). Apart from one missing and one mismatch nucleotide, the sequence of this 300-bp fragment is identical to that of our hDP-2 clone. Further attempts at low-stringency screening have yielded an additional 42 positive clones from different cDNA libraries. However, in each case these clones have been found to correspond to either hDP-1 or hDP-2. Since these clones were detected at relatively high frequency, we believe that hDP-1 and hDP-2 are both likely to make a significant contribution to the endogenous DP activity.  Our sequence begins 26 nucleotides upstream of the first methionine shown in Fig. 1 and does not contain a stop codon in this reading frame prior to the methionine. hDP-2 was independently isolated by Zhang and Chellappan (52a). Their sequence is identical to ours and extends a further 103 nucleotides upstream. This additional sequence includes an inframe stop codon. Thus, the first methionine residue shown in Fig. 1 is thought to be the start site of translation. Expression of hDP-1 and hDP-2 mRNAs. Initially, we sought to determine whether there was any variation in either the level or pattern of expression of hDP-1 and hDP-2. Specific DNA probes were prepared from the carboxy-terminal regions of hDP-1 and hDP-2 where there is little sequence homology and then used to probe Northern blots carrying either total RNA prepared from human cell lines or poly(A)+ RNA from human tissues. The hDP-1-specific probe detected a single 3-kb mRNA in  VOL. 15, 1995  E2F AND DP FAMILY PROTEINS  2539  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  FIG. 2.

Similarly, we were able to detect hDP-1 mRNA in the majority of human tissues tested (Fig. 2C). However, these showed considerable variation in the relative levels of expression. hDP-1 mRNA levels appeared to be considerably higher in muscle than in brain, placenta, and kidney. Expression was also detected in both lung and liver but at lower levels. Finally, hDP-1 mRNA was either absent or below the level of detection in human heart. In contrast to the hDP-1-specific probe, the hDP-2-specific probe detected multiple transcripts (of approximately 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 10 kb) in both cell lines and tissues (Fig. 2B and D). To verify this result, we prepared a second hDP-2-specific probe by using the 5' end of the cDNA (encoding codons 1 to 78). This distinct probe recognized the identical pattern of mRNAs (data not shown). Moreover, since each probe hybridized to only one DNA band in Southern blots of genomic DNA cut with a variety of restriction enzymes (data not shown), the detection of multiple transcripts was unlikely to result from cross-hybridization to related genes. Therefore, we believe that these mRNAs are authentic hDP-2 transcripts that contain both the 5' and 3' coding sequences. To determine whether the hDP-2 coding region was alternatively spliced in any way, RNA from Saos-2 cells (kindly provided by J. Koh), which express at least four of the hDP-2 RNAs, was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. Using two primer sets (corresponding to codons 1 to 7 and 152 to 158 or codons 119 to 125 and nucleotides 38 to 48 downstream from the stop codon), we failed to generate any PCR products that were different in size from similar PCR products synthesized from our original cDNA clone. This suggests that the variation in transcript size is likely  to arise from variations in the length of the 5' and/or 3' untranslated sequences. However, the exact origin of these multiple species of RNA has not been determined. Unlike the case for hDP-1 mRNAs, the levels of hDP-2 mRNAs varied greatly between different cell lines (Fig. 2B). ML-1 cells expressed high levels of the hDP-2 mRNA, whereas 293, U20S, NGP, and HL60 cells had considerably lower levels of all of the transcripts. In human tissues, hDP-2 expression was detected in muscle, kidney, placenta, and liver, all of which also expressed hDP-1 at fairly high levels (Fig. 2D). hDP-2 transcripts were also detected in heart, a tissue in which we were unable to find any hDP-1 expression. In contrast, we failed to detect any expression of hDP-2 in brain, although this tissue expressed moderate levels of the hDP-1 mRNA. Finally, in addition to the apparent low level of hDP-1 expression, lung and pancreas did not give rise to any detectable hDP-2 mRNA. Together, these data suggest that there is considerable variation in the relative levels of hDP-1 and hDP-2 mRNA from different sources. hDP-2 transcripts were detected in a neuroblastoma cell line (IMR32) but not in brain tissue. hDP-1 and hDP-2 cooperate with E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 in DNA binding. Heterodimerization between DP-1 and E2F-1 has been shown to potentiate their pRB binding, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation properties (4, 5, 29, 38). As a first step in comparing the biochemical properties of hDP-1 and hDP-2, we tested the abilities of these proteins to heterodimerize with E2F-1, E2F-2, or E2F-3. E2F and DP expression plasmids were transfected into C33-A cells in pairs, and the resulting cell lysates were tested for the ability to bind to the consensus E2F binding site in gel retardation assays. As shown in Fig. 3, transfection with any of the individual expression plasmids failed to increase the DNA binding activ 2540  WU  ET AL.  MOL. CELL. BIOL.

Similarly, cotransfection of hDP-1 with hDP-2 or any two of the E2F molecules with each other did not form a functional DNA-binding complex (data not shown). However, when either hDP-1 or hDP-2 was cotransfected with any member of the E2F family of proteins, the DNA binding activity was significantly increased (Fig. 3, lanes 9 to 14). As expected, antibody supershifts confirm that these proteinDNA complexes contain both the E2F and DP subunits (see below). hDP-1 and hDP-2 activate transcription with E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3. Having determined that hDP-1 and hDP-2 can efficiently heterodimerize with all three E2Fs to increase their affinities for DNA, we wished to determine whether this dimerization also affected the abilities of these proteins to activate transcription. Different combinations of the E2F and DP expression vectors were transfected into C33-A cells along with a reporter construct (E2F4-BCAT) in which transcription of the CAT gene is regulated by four E2F binding sites upstream of the TATA box of the adenovirus E1B gene (29). As shown in Fig. 4, transfection of 100 ng of pCMV-hDP-1 or pCMV-hDP-2 generated 10- or 20-fold activation of transcription over the vector control plasmid. Similarly, 100 ng of either pCMV-E2F-1 (89-437), pCMV-E2F-2 (85-437), or pCMV-E2F-3 (132-425) alone generated 20-, 10-, and 11-fold activation, respectively. However, when 100 ng of the E2F expression plasmids was cotransfected with increasing amounts of the DP expression plasmid, synergistic activation was achieved, allowing a 70- to 400-fold induction (Fig. 4). hDP-1 and hDP-2 associate with pRB but not p107 when complexed with E2F-1, E2F-2, or E2F-3. Previous studies have suggested that E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 all bind specifically to pRB and not p107 (28, 35, 36, 41, 50). Therefore, we wished to determine whether this specificity was maintained when these  proteins were bound to either hDP-1 or hDP-2. As a first approach, we tested whether these DP/E2F heterodimers were able to associate with pRB or p107 when they were overexpressed by transient transfection (Fig. 3, lanes 15 to 26). The various combinations of E2F and DP expression plasmids were cotransfected into C33-A cells along with either the pCMVpRB or pCMV-p107 expression construct, and the resulting cell extracts were then tested in gel retardation assays. Coexpression of pRB resulted in the appearance of a more slowly migrating E2F complex in band shift assays (Fig. 3, lanes 15 to 20), and antibody supershift confirmed the presence of pRB within this upper band (data not shown). In contrast, p107 did not appear to associate with any of the E2F/DP/DNA complexes (Fig. 3, lanes 21 to 26), although immunoblotting confirmed that pRB and p107 were expressed at similar levels in these experiments (53). This finding suggests that the specificity of E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 for pRB is maintained regardless of the nature of the DP subunit. The specificity of these interactions was supported by several of the experiments described below. The transcriptional activity of the E2F/DP heterodimers is inhibited by pRB. The tumor suppression function of pRB is thought to arise, at least in part, from its ability to inhibit the transcriptional activity of E2F. Since pRB appears to bind to each of the six possible combinations of E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 with hDP-1 and hDP-2, we wished to determine whether this binding was sufficient to inhibit their transcriptional activities. Each combination of the E2F/DP expression vectors was transfected into the pRB-negative C33-A cells in the presence or absence of expression vectors containing either the wildtype RB-1 gene (pCMV-pRB) or a naturally occurring mutant form of the RB-1 gene (pCMV-pRBDelta22) that lacks exon 22 (33). In each case, the activities of these complexes were as VOL.  15, 1995  E2F AND DP FAMILY PROTEINS  2541  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  FIG. 4.

The reporter plasmid (E2F4-BCAT) contains four E2F binding sites upstream of the E1B TATA box and CAT gene. Transfection efficiency was normalized by luciferase activity (15).

As before, the various E2F/DP combinations all increased transcription of this reporter by at least 80-fold (Fig. 5). This activation was not significantly altered by the presence of the mutant non-E2F-binding form of pRB. In contrast, the wildtype pRB was able to reduce the transcriptional activity of all of these complexes by at least 10-fold. This finding suggests that pRB is able to block transcriptional activation of all of these E2F/DP heterodimers. hDP-1 and hDP-2 are associated with all of the endogenous E2F DNA binding activity in ML-1 cells. The studies described above demonstrate that hDP-1 and hDP-2 are capable of heterodimerizing with E2F-1, E2F-2, or E2F-3 to generate a functional E2F transcriptional activator. Since all of these assays are dependent upon the overexpression of the relevant proteins following transfection, they fail to demonstrate whether these individual complexes exist in vivo and what fraction they contribute to the endogenous E2F activity. To analyze complexes formed by the endogenous hDP-1 and hDP-2, we prepared mouse polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that were specific for these proteins. Mice were immunized with either a GST fusion protein that contains the first 204 residues of hDP-1 (29) or polyhistidine-tagged hDP-1 or hDP-2 protein. Polyclonal antibodies against both hDP-1 and hDP-2 and monoclonal antibodies against hDP-1 were prepared. Initially, we tested these antibodies for their specificity. hDP-1 or hDP-2 protein was synthesized from an in vitro transcription-translation reaction. In immunoprecipitations, the antibodies were specific for the appropriate immunogen and showed no evidence of cross-reaction to the other DP (data not shown). Next we tested both these antibodies and those raised against the E2F proteins (29, 41) for the ability to  FIG. 5. pRB suppresses E2F/DP transactivation.

(A) Three E2F and two DP antibodies were tested in gel shift assays with whole-cell extract made from cells cotransfected with E2F/DP genes as indicated. Anti-E2F-1 is a monoclonal antibody (KH20); 1 mul of this tissue culture supernatant of the hybridoma cells was used in the DNA binding reactions. Other antibodies were mouse polysera raised against recombinant proteins as described in Materials and Methods; 1 mul of each mouse serum was used per reaction.

Control antibodies are normal mouse serum (NMS), Pab419 (anti-T antigen), and anti-hDP-2 mouse serum.  recognize native E2F and DP proteins in gel retardation assays (Fig. 6). In each case, these antibodies were mixed with the lysates of cells that had been transfected with combinations of E2F and DP, and the resultant complexes were analyzed by gel shift assays. As shown previously (Fig. 3), the E2F-1/DP and E2F-2/DP complexes migrated with the endogenous free E2F, whereas E2F-3, which is expressed as an amino-terminally truncated protein, migrated faster than the endogenous free E2F when bound by either DP subunit. The antibodies raised against E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 were able to shift their respective protein-DNA complexes specifically (Fig. 6A, lanes 2, 7, 12, and 18). hDP-1 antiserum and three of the four hDP-1 monoclonal antibodies used in this assay shifted the transfected hDP-1/E2F-3 complex, as well as the bulk of the endogenous free E2F, but did not alter the hDP-2/E2F-3 complex (Fig. 6A, lanes 14 and 17; Fig. 6B, lanes 4 to 7 and 12 to 15). This finding confirmed that the hDP-1 antibodies were specific and also indicated that the endogenous free E2F contains a significant amount of hDP-1. In the same experiment, hDP-2 antibody specifically shifted the hDP-2/E2F-3 complex but not the hDP-1/E2F-3 complex or the endogenous free E2F (Fig. 6A, lanes 13 and 16; Fig. 6B, lanes 8 and 16). Having generated antibodies that are capable of specifically supershifting all of the relevant complexes, we were then able to use these antibodies to analyze the composition of the endogenous E2F complexes. ML-1 cells were chosen for these assays because they showed high levels of both hDP-1 and hDP-2 mRNAs, as judged by Northern blotting. ML-1 cell lysates consistently generated four distinct E2F/DNA bands in gel shift assay that correspond to the p107/cyclin A or E/cdk2/ E2F complex, the pRB/E2F complex, and the two free E2F bands (Fig. 7, lane 1). In earlier experiments, we noted that the anti-hDP-1 antibodies appeared to shift a large proportion of the free E2F as well as the majority of the pRB/E2F band and a portion of the  FIG. 7. hDP-1 and hDP-2 are associated with most E2F binding activity in vivo.

Equivalent ML-1 proteins depleted by hDP-1 antibodies (lane 7 to 12) or by Pab419 antibody (lane 13 to 18) were used in the same experiment. The p107/E2F and pRB/E2F complexes were identified by specific antibody supershift (data not shown).

ML-1 cell extract was immunoprecipitated (IP) by anti-simian virus 40 T antigen (Anti T Ag) Pab416, anti-pRB XZ77, or anti-p107 antibodies (a combination of SD2, SD4, SD6, SD9, and SD15), and the immune complexes were incubated with 0.8% deoxycholate (DOC) to release associated E2F activity. The samples were then used in gel shift assays and were incubated with 1 mul of tissue culture supernatants (anti-T-antigen monoclonal antibody Pab419 and anti-E2F-1 monoclonal antibody KH20) or 1 mul of mouse sera (anti-E2F-2, anti-E2F-3, anti-hDP-1, and anti-hDP-2), except for lane 7 in panel A, in which case 2 mul of anti-E2F-2 mouse serum was used.  p107/E2F bands (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 5). The addition of hDP-2 antibodies appeared to change the pattern of bands but did not clearly supershift a large portion of the available E2F (Fig. 7, lane 6). To make this distinction more clearly, we removed all of the hDP-1-immunoreactive proteins by preclearing the ML-1 lysates with hDP-1 monoclonal antibodies prior to the gel shift. This made the activities of the hDP-2 antibodies easier to see. As shown in Fig. 7 (lane 12), the anti-hDP-2 antibodies were able to supershift all remaining E2F activities. Together, these results suggest that hDP-1 and hDP-2 are associated with most or all the endogenous E2F DNA binding activity in these cells. hDP-1 and hDP-2 are associated with both pRB and p107 in vivo. We and others have previously shown that E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 display a strong specificity for binding to pRB but not p107 in both in vivo and in vitro assays. This specificity is maintained when E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 are complexed with either hDP-1 or hDP-2 (see above). However, analysis of the endogenous E2F complexes suggests that these DP proteins might bind to both pRB and p107 in vivo. We therefore tested whether hDP-1 and hDP-2 could be detected in immunoprecipitates of pRB and p107. E2F/DP complexes that were associated with pRB and p107 were immunoprecipitated from ML-1 cell lysate by using monoclonal antibodies that are specific to either pRB or p107. The proteins were then released by detergent (deoxycholate) treatment and analyzed in band shift assays. As has been reported previously (9, 10, 39, 51), pRB and p107 immunoprecipitates contain a substantial quantity of E2F DNA binding activity (Fig. 8). Using the specific antibodies, we were then able to test the composition of the released E2F. Exactly as expected, E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 antibodies shifted the E2F/DNA complex associated with pRB (Fig. 8A,  lanes 5 to 8) but not with p107 (Fig. 8B, lanes 4 to 6). In contrast, hDP-1 and hDP-2 antibodies shifted both pRB- and p107-bound E2F (Fig. 8A, lanes 8 and 9; Fig. 8B, lanes 7 and 8). This finding demonstrates that both hDP-1 and hDP-2 associate with pRB and p107 in vivo. DISCUSSION The cellular transcription factor E2F plays a key role in regulating the expression of genes that are required for cell cycle progression (46). This transcriptional activity appears to arise from the concerted action of a family of proteins that can be subdivided on the basis of their sequence homology into two distinct groups called E2F and DP. Recent studies suggest that formation of functional E2F is dependent upon the association of E2F and DP subunits (4, 29, 38). This heterodimerization appears to be essential for both high-affinity DNA binding and efficient transcriptional activation. However, all of these studies have relied on either in vitro binding or overexpression assays. We therefore know very little about the composition of the endogenous E2F or the relative functions of the individual E2F proteins in vivo. Here we have shown that the endogenous DP activity is due to the action of at least two proteins, hDP-1 and hDP-2. These proteins are both capable of binding to E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction leads to highaffinity DNA binding and increased transcriptional activation in vivo. Consistent with this observation, we can readily detect both hDP-1 and hDP-2 in association with pRB and p107 in vivo. Since we are unable to detect any association between p107 and E2F-1, E2F-2, or E2F-3, hDP-1 and hDP-2 also must heterodimerize with the p107-specific E2F(s). The recent clon 2544  WU  ET AL.  MOL. CELL. BIOL.  FIG. 9. Schematic illustration of components of E2F complexes described in this study or referenced in the text.  ing and characterization of E2F-4 has indicated that it is one of these p107-specific E2Fs (7, 19, 48a, 52a). By using specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, we have shown that all of the endogenous E2F DNA binding activity contains either hDP-1 or hDP-2. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that there are additional DP molecules which are immunologically similar to hDP-1 and hDP-2, this finding suggests that these proteins account for most or all of the observed DP activity in vivo in the cell lines that we have tested (ML-1, HL60, 293, CEM, HeLa, etc.). The data described above suggest that the DP subunits make little or no contribution to the specificity of pRB/p107 binding to the E2F complex but act as an essential partner for all of the E2F molecules. We have found considerable variation in the expression patterns of the two hDP proteins. In a manner similar to that of many of the cell lines that we have analyzed, hDP-1 and hDP-2 are clearly coexpressed in muscle, kidney, placenta, and liver. In contrast, some tissues appear to express only hDP-1 (brain) or hDP-2 (heart). In light of the apparent differences in the contribution of these proteins to the free, transcriptionally active E2F, the levels and activities of the functional E2F may vary enormously in these different tissues. It is attractive to think that each of the individual E2F/DP complexes is differentially regulated by its specific association with either pRB-, p107-, or p130-containing complexes in a manner that would give rise to the differential activation of different responsive genes. Structures of the complexes are shown in Fig. 9. We are currently trying to understand how the individual E2F/DP complexes contribute to the activation of known target genes.  Our E2F antibodies appear to be extremely efficient at supershifting complexes generated by transfecting cells with DP/ E2F-1, DP/E2F-2, or DP/E2F-3. We were therefore surprised to find that, either separately or together, they were unable to supershift a large fraction of the free E2F complex (Fig. 6). There are several possibilities to explain this observation. First, the endogenous E2F proteins may be modified in some way so that they are no longer recognized by the antibodies. Second, the endogenous free E2F may be a mixture of many different E2Fs, each of which contributes only a small fraction of the total free E2F. If this is true, in order to be undetectable in the gel shift assay, E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 must contribute less than 10% of the total binding activity. Finally, it is possible that the endogenous free E2F consists of an E2F molecule or molecules distinct from E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3. Since we believe that E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 account for all of the pRBbound E2F activity, these observations pose interesting questions about the relative contributions that the pRB-, p107-, and p130-regulated E2Fs make to the pool of the free transcriptionally active E2F. While this report was under review, the cloning and characterization of two new DP-1 related polypeptides from Xenopus laevis were reported (20). These clones were named xDP-1 and xDP-2. The xDP-1 and hDP-1 polypeptides are clearly related, having similar lengths and 86% amino acid identity. xDP-2 and hDP-2 are also related, again having similar lengths but with only 72% amino acid identity. The strong identity between xDP-1 and hDP-1 indicates that these genes are true homologs, and it seems unlikely that a more closely related Xenopus relative of human DP-1 will be found. While the xDP-2 and hDP-2 polypeptides are also clearly related and are more closely related to each other than to either xDP-1 or hDP1, we believe that their relationship as homologs should be regarded carefully. In this report we have used the designation hDP-2 rather than hDP3 for a number of reasons. First, the hDP-2 designation has been used in published reports for over a year, and we feel that this fact establishes some priority. Second, the hDP-2 cDNA and antibodies have been freely available from our laboratory for some time, and we know of several manuscripts in preparation in which this name is used. Finally, there are already several published references in which the DP-2 designation is used to describe the clone and protein characterized here. For these reasons, we believe that changing the name of hDP-2 would generate confusion in the literature. Nonetheless, researchers should be aware that the xDP-2 and hDP-2 cDNAs have not been formally shown to be homologs, and we recommend adhering closely to the use of the h and x prefixes for the human and Xenopus versions until more experimental evidence can be established to determine whether these genes are true homologs.

																											<Abstract>The helical cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and its specific binding subunit IL-6R alpha form a 1:1 complex which, by promoting homodimerization of the signalling subunit gp130 on the surface of target cells, triggers intracellular responses. We expressed differently tagged forms of gp130 and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gp130 undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6R alpha of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6R alpha bind a single gp130 molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gp130. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gp130 dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6R alpha and two gp130 molecules.

We expressed differently tagged forms of gpl3O and used them in solution-phase binding assays to show that the soluble extracellular domains of gpl3O undergo dimerization in the absence of membranes. In vitro receptor assembly reactions were also performed in the presence of two sets of IL-6 variants carrying amino acid substitutions in two distinct areas of the cytokine surface (site 2, comprising exposed residues in the A and C helices, and site 3, in the terminal part of the CD loop). The binding affinity to IL-6Ra of these variants is normal but their biological activity is poor or absent. We demonstrate here that both the site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants complexed with IL-6Rax bind a single gpl3O molecule but are unable to dimerize it, whereas the combined site 2/3 variants lose the ability to interact with gpl3O. The binding properties of these variants in vitro, and the result of using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against site 3, lead to the conclusion that gpl3O dimer is formed through direct binding at two independent and differently oriented sites on IL-6. Immunoprecipitation experiments further reveal that the fully assembled receptor complex is composed of two IL-6, two IL-6Ra and two gpl3O molecules. We propose here a model representing the IL-6 receptor complex as hexameric, which might be common to other helical cytokines. Key words: gp13O dimer/IL-6 receptor antagonist/IL-6 receptor complex/IL-6Ra  Introduction Interleukin (IL) 6 is a multifunctional cytokine that acts different target cells to induce a variety of biological responses (Van Snick, 1990). Transmembrane glycoproteins that form the IL-6 receptor complex have been identified and cloned (Yamasaki et al., 1988; Hibi et al., 1990). Two membrane proteins are both necessary and sufficient to constitute a functional receptor complex: on  IL-6Ra (also referred to as the ax subunit) and gpl 30 (also referred to as the B subunit). IL-6Ra specifically binds IL-6 at a relatively low affinity (10-9 M; Yamasaki et al., 1988). The IL-6-IL-6Rax complex associates with gpl3O at high affinity (10-11 M) thus promoting signal transduction inside the cell (Hibi et al., 1990). Both IL-6Rax and gpl30 belong to the haematopoietin receptor superfamily that includes, among others, the growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHbp) (Cosman, 1993). These receptors all share sequence and structural similarities in a 220 amino acid region called the cytokine binding domain (CBD), located in the extracellular portion of the molecule (Bazan, 1990b). Moreover, all the corresponding cytokines are predicted to fold as a bundle of four a-helices (Bazan, 1990a, 1991). From sequence and structural similarities with the GH receptor complex, whose structure has been solved by Xray crystallography (de Vos et al., 1992), we built a computer-assisted 3-D model of the IL-6-IL-6Ra-gp 130 interaction (Savino et al., 1994a,b; Lahm et al., 1995). In analogy with GH, the IL-6 receptor complex was envisaged as a heterotrimer in which a single IL-6 molecule bridges the IL-6Rax and the gpl3O CBDs. In this complex, the IL-6 contact surface with IL-6Rax is formed by residues in the putative D helix and AB loop (site 1), whereas its binding site to gpl30 constitutes exposed residues in the A and C helices (site 2; Savino et al., 1994a,b). Furthermore, residues in the E2 strand and AB2 loop of the CBDs of gpl30 and IL-6Rax form a third interface (Yawata et al., 1993; Lahm et al., 1995). The reliability of the model was tested by site-directed mutagenesis of both IL-6 and IL-6Rax; variants bearing amino acid substitutions of residues postulated to be at receptor-cytokine or receptor-receptor interfaces confirmed the phenotypes predicted from the model (Savino et al., 1994a,b). This heterotrimeric model does not, however, explain additional findings. A key event in the IL-6 signalling cascade is the dimerization of the gpl 30 chain (Murakami et al., 1993) that activates (i) associated tyrosine kinases of the Jak family and (ii) the phosphorylation of a set of intracellular substrates, including the intracytoplasmic domain of gpl30 and transcription factors of the STAT family (Stahl et al., 1994; Zhong et al., 1994). These observations have led to the conclusion that a second gpl30 molecule participates in the active IL-6 receptor complex. Additional information on the complexity of the IL-6 receptor complex has emerged from the recently developed IL-6 receptor antagonists. Different strategies have been adopted to design these IL-6 variants, aimed at generating molecules that can still effectively bind IL-6Ra but can carry amino acid substitutions that impair the activation of gpl3O by the IL-6-IL-6Rcx complex. Interestingly, two strategies developed independently produced IL-6  1942  IL-6 receptor complex assembly  antagonists with the expected properties by mutating two different portions of the IL-6 four-helix bundle. The first portion is a patch of four exposed residues in the A and C helices, which we called site 2 (Savino et al., 1994a,b) because its location is similar to site 2 in GH. The second is formed by residues located at the beginning of the D helix and AB loop [referred to as site II by Brakenhoff et al. (1994) and Ehlers et al. (1994)], which we call site 3. The location of site 3 does not fit into the GH paradigm. To investigate further the unique properties of the IL-6 receptor complex, we developed a very sensitive assay to analyse the biochemical steps of receptor assembly. Differentially tagged versions of soluble gpl30 and IL-6Rax receptors are expressed in insect cells and are used in immunoprecipitation reactions with wild-type and variant IL-6 and IL-6Rx molecules. Our results indicate that the IL-6 -IL-6Rx complex binds two gp 130 molecules at two distinct and independent binding sites. Furthermore, we provide evidence that two IL-6, two IL-6Rx and two gp130 molecules are present in the final complex, and give details on their topological location in this putative 'hexamer'. A model is presented which reconciles this structure with that of the trimeric GH receptor complex and suggests that a similar assembly process might also take place for other helical cytokines.

Results An in vitro assay for gpl30 homodimerization Homodimerization of gpl 30 has been shown to take place on the surface of cells exposed to IL-6 (Murakami et al., 1993). To test whether gpl30 requires the transmembrane and intracytoplasmic regions to dimerize or, on the contrary, is an intrinsic property of the extracellular domain, we decided to set up an in vitro dimerization assay. To do this, we expressed gpl30 in its soluble form (sgp 130), truncated at the predicted junction between extracellular and transmembrane domains, and modified at the C-terminus so as to carry two different epitope tags: sgpl3O-myc carrying a myc tag (Evan et al., 1985) and sgpl 30-FLAG with a FLAG tag (Hopp et al., 1988). This makes the different sgpl30 molecules recognizable by specific monoclonal antibodies. Likewise, two recombinant soluble forms of IL-6Ra were generated, one truncated at residue 322 of the extracellular domain, the other with a myc tag attached to the same C-terminal residue. All cDNAs encoded their natural leader peptide sequence. The modified cDNAs were inserted in the recombination vector under the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter. Recombinant plasmids were transfected in Sf9 cells and the recombinant viruses expressing the various receptors were purified and amplified. Recombinant receptors were produced by infecting insect cells in serum-free medium. Supematants were assayed by Western blot for recombinant protein production (Figure IA). Individual receptors were metabolically labelled with [35S]methionine at high specific activity and low background compared with other proteins (Figure 1B). Receptors expressed in insect cells show a molecular weight of -40 kDa for sIL6Rax and 72 kDa for gp 130, suggesting that these molecules are subjected to post-translation modifications but to a lesser extent than when expressed in mammalian cells (Sporeno et al., 1994). The expression levels of the two  forms of sgpl 30 and of sIL-6Ra were estimated to be 12 mg/l for sgp 130 and 5-7 mgIl for sIL-6Rcx after affinity purification (G.Paonessa, unpublished observations). The strategy adopted for the gpl 30 dimerization assay is depicted in Figure 2A. In a typical experiment, unlabelled sgpl30-myc was immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads coated with the specific anti-myc monoclonal antibody. After washing, immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence of various combinations of IL-6, IL-6Rax (labelled or unlabelled) and [35S]gpl30-FLAG. Because the latter is not recognized by the anti-myc monoclonal antibody, its immunoprecipitation can only be explained by assuming that gpl30 dimers had been formed. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 2B, where the efficient in vitro formation of gpl30 dimers was confirmed by the immunoprecipitation of labelled gpl 30-FLAG by anti-myc antibodies. As expected, dimers were only formed in the presence of both IL-6 and IL6Ra. Likewise, IL-6Rax was immunoprecipitated only in the presence of IL-6 (Figure 2B).  Dimerization of gp 130 is triggered by two independent binding sites on IL-6 Recently, IL-6 variants have been generated which act as receptor antagonists (Brakenhoff et al., 1994; Savino et al., 1994a,b). In these variants, amino acid substitutions were introduced in two distinct areas of the IL-6 surface, as predicted by the 3-D model shown in Figure 3. These mutant proteins can be subdivided into two classes: (i) site 2 variants, bearing mutations in helix A and C, and (ii) site 3 variants, bearing mutations at the beginning of helix D. The identification of two distant sites on IL-6 with similar roles in promoting signal transduction, together with the evidence that the signalling subunit undergoes dimerization, immediately suggest that these sites are independent binding sites for the two gp 130 subunits. To test this hypothesis we decided to evaluate their ability to bind baculovirus sgpl 30 and dimerize it in vitro.  1943  G.Paonessa et al. A B 7  :t  1?

Fig. 2. sgpl30 is able to dimerize in vitro in the presence of IL-6-sIL-6Rax. (A) Experimental strategy. sgpl3O-myc is attached to protein A-Sepharose beads via anti-myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody and incubated with different combinations of IL-6, sIL-6RaX and sgpl30-FLAG. The participation of a specific molecule in the complex is detected by the use of a 35S-labelled form of a specific receptor chain. After incubation and washing of the Sepharose beads, the bound material is eluted with SDS loading buffer and subjected to PAGE. (B) The experiment has been performed according to the experimental strategy shown in (A). Cold sgpl30-myc attached on protein A-Sepharose beads was incubated with the molecules indicated on top of each lane in the following amounts: 3 tg IL-6, 500 gl supernatant containing cold sIL-6Roa and 50 Plt supernatant containing 35S-labelled receptors. Rx, slL-6Rax; 130, sgpl3O-FLAG. Asterisks indicate 35S-labelled material.  From the site 2 variants we selected the four amino acid substitution Y31 D/G35F/S 118RNV 121 D, also called DFRD, which acts as a full IL-6 antagonist on a variety of human cell lines (Savino et al., 1994b). For site 3, the variant Q159E/T162P was described which also has low biological activity and acts as a partial antagonist on some but not all human cell lines (Brakenhoff et al., 1994). To avoid introducing proline residues which might affect folding or stability, we generated two new variants (WI57R/Dl60R and T162D) which map in the same area and have similar properties to Q159E/T162P. The properties of all the IL-6 variants used in this study are summarized in Table I, which reports in vitro binding to sIL-6Rcx as measured by ELISA (Savino et al., 1994a) and biological activity on two different human cell lines with different degrees of sensitivity to human IL-6. Both site 2 and site 3 variants have normal binding affinity to IL-6Rax, as well as a strongly impaired biological activity. To measure binding to gpl30, Sepharose beads coated with anti-myc monoclonal antibody were incubated with the myc-tagged preparation of sIL-6Rx and then used to co-immunoprecipitate labelled sgp 130-FLAG in the presence of the wild-type or mutant IL-6 molecule. All three variants (DFRD, W157R/D160R and T162D) immunoprecipitated sgp130 with an efficiency only -2to 4-fold lower than wild-type IL-6 (Figure 4A). This result differs from that reported previously with a different site 2 variant 31D/35F using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-derived sgp130, where a stronger defect in gp130 binding was observed (Savino et al., 1994a). This discrepancy has also been observed consistently with the site 2 and site 3 variants used in this study (results not shown). We believe this is due to a significant difference in receptor concentration, whereby the use of baculovirus sgp 130 reveals residual binding of these variants that cannot be detected under the limiting conditions imposed by the use of the CHO-derived sgpl30. 1944  NH2  Fig. 3.

The IL-6 biological activity measured on the HepG2 hepatoma cell line is the activation of the transfected IL-6-inducible C-reactive protein gene promoter (Savino et al., 1994b). The biological activity of each variant (expressed as percentage of wild-type IL-6 activity) on both cell lines was determined as the ratio between the concentration of wild-type IL-6 and the concentration of variant IL-6 necessary to give 50% of wild-type IL-6 maximal stimulation.

After incubation and washing, the bound material was subjected to PAGE. M, molecular weight marker.  When the dimerization assay was performed using the protocol described in the previous section, all the IL-6 variants showed a selective and dramatic decrease (Figure 4B), in precise parallel with their impairment of bioactivity (Table I). In fact, DFRD, which does not possess residual bioactivity and is a full antagonist (Savino et al., 1994b), does not dimerize gpl3O at all, whereas variants W157R/ Dl 60R and T 1 62D show a residual activity of -3 and 1% respectively in HepG2 cells and are reduced in gp 130 dimerization to -6 and 4% respectively. From these results we can conclude that both site 2 and site 3 variants, while still maintaining the capability to recruit gpl30 in the presence of IL-6Ra, cannot form gp 130 dimers. This finding explains the lack of biological activity. What has to be taken into account, however, is that the DFRD  mutation involving four amino acid residues is likely to completely abolish the interaction with the gp130 subunit binding at site 2, while the leaky mutations W1 57R/ D160R and T162D do not fully impair the interaction of the respective gpl30 subunits binding at site 3. Apparently, the two areas of the IL-6 surface affected by these mutations behave as independent gpl30 binding sites, because both site 2 and site 3 variants are able to bind one gpl30 molecule efficiently. To analyse this further, two more variants bearing simultaneous mutations at sites 2 and 3 were generated (DFRD/W157R/D160R and DFRD/T162D). These variants maintain normal IL6Ra binding (Table I) and, as expected, are biologically inactive. When tested for sgpl30 binding, although with only slight differences, both variants were almost com1945  G.Paonessa et aL  wt IL-6 '1 I I:,sI:Iii Ir 0 !N 1.i:3 O 'l:I  I;0 1  'r  '1  _.  am  a*GM  ,lb  v   -W  mode  A + B Fig. 5.

Site 3 mutant  Site 2 mutant  pletely unable to bind sgpl30 (Figure 4A). The residual binding can be explained if we assume that residual binding still occurs at site 3 as discussed above. As expected, these variants did not dimerize gpl30 (Figure 4B). The 'two independent sites' hypothesis was tested further using the specific anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody mAb 16 (Brakenhoff et al., 1990). mAb 16 has been shown previously to inhibit the biological activity of IL-6 without interfering with its cell surface binding (Brakenhoff et al., 1992). This led to the hypothesis that mAb 16 impairs the interaction of IL-6 with gp130 but not with IL-6Rcx. The epitope recognized by mAb 16 was localized within the region between Q154 and T162, and this information was used for the development of site 3 IL-6 receptor antagonists (Brakenhoff et al., 1992, 1994). In the light of these findings, we speculated that if IL-6 presents two independent binding sites for gpl30, site 2 and site 3, the binding of mAb 16 could block only site 3, leaving site 2 free to interact with another gp 130 molecule. Therefore we performed immunoprecipitations with mAb 16 using wild-type or mutant IL-6, and tested their ability to bind and immunoprecipitate labelled IL-6Ra and sgpl30. Initial results showed that of the site 3 mutations, W157R/D160R destroys the mAb 16 epitope whereas T162D can still be recognized by the antibody (data not shown). As shown in Figure 5, all the variants tested bind sIL6Rax efficiently, in agreement with the observation that mAb 16 does not interfere with this interaction. Moreover, mAb 16 still allowed wild-type IL-6 to interact efficiently with sgpl30, promoting its co-immunoprecipitation. Not surprisingly, this interaction took place only in the presence of IL-6Ra, thus excluding the possibility that the neutralizing effect of this monoclonal antibody is due to a complete inhibition of gpl30 interaction with the IL-6-IL-6Ra complex. Hence, the biological effect of mAb 16 is due to a selective inhibition of gpl130 dimerization. Indeed, while the site 3-type T162D variant is still able to bind sgpl3O in the presence of mAb 16, the site 2-type  mode A mode B Fig. 6. Schematic representation of A and B modes of interaction of the IL-6Rax-IL-6  complex with gpl30 molecules.  DFRD variant shows no residual binding to sgpl 30. Most probably, both sites are unavailable for this interaction, site 2 because of the mutation and site 3 because of the steric hindrance due to the bound antibody molecule. In conclusion, by using a variety of tools it was possible to distinguish two independent modes of interaction of gpl 30 with the IL-6- IL-6Roa complex (outlined in Figure 6). In mode A one gpl3O chain is oriented in a similar fashion to the second GHbp chain in the GH receptor complex (de Vos et al., 1992); in mode B the second gp 130 chain binds site 3 on IL-6 and is oriented differently to one side of the IL-6-IL-6Ra complex (Figure 6). In the presence of wild-type IL-6 both modes operate simultaneously and lead to gpl30 homodimerization.  A variant in the E2 strand of the cytokine binding domain of IL-6Rla is selectively impaired in gp 130 dimerization Previous mutagenesis experiments with human IL-6Ra provided some information about the composition of the IL-6Rx-gpl3O interface (Yawata et al., 1993). Out of a large set of receptor variants, only a limited subset of amino acid substitutions in the IL-6Ra CBD was able to selectively reduce binding to gpl30 while leaving the affinity for IL-6 intact. The majority of these mutations map in the E2 strand and AB2 loop of subdomain 2 of the receptor CBD, which is also the location of the binding interface between the two GH receptor chains in the GH-(GHbp)2 complex (de Vos et al., 1992; Yawata et al., 1993). Based on these findings we produced an IL-6Ra variant carrying two substitutions in the E2 strand (H280S/ D28 1 V) which was called Mutl. The construction of Mut 1 and the characterization of its biochemical properties will be described elsewhere (A.L.Salvati, A.Lahm, G.Paonessa,  1946  IL-6 receptor complex assembly :\ -II t:g-t  e~~~~~~Ii -f;it ------- to  that obtained when the complex used is formed by wild-type IL-6Rca and a combined IL-6 site 2/3 variant  (Figure 4B).  13  IbFt ¢  Ii  w  ]-ii V  I.-t; v M  II  Fig. 7.

After incubation and washing, the bound material was subjected to PAGE. M, molecular weight marker.  G.Ciliberto and C.Toniatti, manuscript in preparation). Mutl is able to bind IL-6 with an affinity similar to that of wild-type IL-6Ra; therefore, the Mut I -wtIL-6 complex was tested for binding and its ability to promote dimerization of gp130. The results are shown in Figure 7A. Interestingly, Mut I in combination with wild-type IL-6 still interacts with gp 130 but displays a selective impairment in gpl30 dimerization: this behaviour mirrors that of site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants. According to the GH-(GHbp)2-based trimeric model of the IL-6-IL-6Ra-gpl30 interaction, the site defined by Mutl in IL-6Rax is projected in the same orientation (and towards the same gpl30 molecule) as site 2 on IL-6. This implies that gpl30 cannot bind in mode A (Figure 6) to the Mutl - wtIL-6 complex, and that the residual binding is due to gpl30 interactions in the B mode. As discussed before, this second gp 130 appeared to be recruited in the complex with the contribution of site 3 in IL-6. To test this hypothesis we performed immunoprecipitation experiments combining Mutl with a representative site 2 or site 3 variant. The results are shown in Figure 7B. In agreement with our predictions, the incubation of Mutl with DFRD, which is a site 2 IL-6 variant, still results in binding to gp130. In contrast, although the site 3 T162D variant has normal binding affinity for Muti (data not shown), the complex formed by Mutl and T162D has lost any residual binding to gp 130: this result is similar  The IL-6 receptor complex is a hexamer which contains two IL-6, two IL-6Ra and two gpl30 molecules Structural comparisons and functional studies had suggested previously that the assembly of the IL-6 receptor complex requires the formation of an IL-6-IL-6Ragpl 30 heterotrimer which is structurally and topologically similar to the one assembled by GH-(GHbp)2 (Savino et al., 1994a,b; Lahm et al., 1995). The experiments presented here might indicate, however, that the functional complex is instead a tetramer, differing from the trimer by an additional binding of a second gpl30 subunit with a 'novel' orientation. Alternatively, and most probably, it is possible that the functional complex has a different structure in which two trimeric complexes of the GHtype cluster close to each other to form a higher order symmetrical structure. To gain further insight into the stoichiometry of the IL-6 receptor complex, we designed immunoprecipitation experiments to test if in vitro complexes contain more than one IL-6Ra and/or IL-6 molecule. To this end, Sepharose beads were coated with unlabelled myc-tagged sIL-6Ra (via anti-myc monoclonal antibody) and immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence of various combinations of IL-6, sgpl30 (labelled or unlabelled) and [35S]IL-6Rx. The results (Figure 8A) demonstrate that for IL-6Ra a second molecule is also recruited in the receptor complex in the presence of the other two components, namely IL-6 and sgp 130. Finally, to assess whether a second IL-6 molecule is also associated with the complex we used an IL-6 variant which bears the myc tag at its N-terminus (called hereafter IL-6myc). This molecule, produced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity, is as biologically active as wild-type IL-6 (data not shown) and has the advantage of being specifically recognized by the anti-myc monoclonal antibody. The usual immunoprecipitation strategy was followed using cold IL-6myc as the 'first' IL-6 molecule, in vitro 35S-labelled wild-type IL-6 as the 'second' IL-6 molecule and various combinations of receptors. As shown in Figure 8B, IL-6 also undergoes in vitro dimerization but only in the presence of both IL-6Ra and gpl 30. In conclusion, these experiments show that the incubation of IL-6 with the extracellular domains of IL-6Ra and gp 130 causes the formation of complexes in which not only two gp 130 subunits, but also two IL-6 molecules and two IL-6Ra subunits, are present.  Discussion IL-6 stimulation of target cells causes covalent dimerization of the signal-transducing chain gp 130, and these dimers have been found to be constantly associated with functional receptor complexes (Davis et al., 1993; Murakami et al., 1993). Although gp 130 dimerization has been observed on cell membrane and therefore with the whole receptor molecule, we show here that this event is driven by the extracellular domains of both the ca 1947  G.Paonessa et aL  A  IL-6 - IL-6 - *Rct *Ra *Ra *Rci *130 '130 - - 130 130 IL-6 - sgp130_-  4  sIL-6Ra-t  w  B 35S-ILL-6 +  +  +  +  + -  REx  Rct 130  130  M  IL6  -_  w  Fig. 8.

(IL-6Ra) and f3 (gpl30) receptor subunits because we observe efficient dimerization in the absence of both the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. We believe that these dimers faithfully reproduce what occurs on the cell surface, because their formation depends completely on the presence of IL-6-IL-6Rax complexes and they are not formed when IL-6 variants with normal binding affinity for IL-6Rx, but low or no biological activity, are used in place of wild-type IL-6. The design of IL-6 receptor antagonists to be used for the treatment of IL-6 disregulation was approached with the idea that such molecules should possess normal (or improved) IL-6Ra binding affinity but impaired interaction with gpl3O (Brakenhoff et al., 1994; Savino et al., 1994a,b). Interestingly, our results revealed that IL-6 receptor antagonists like DFRD (Savino et al., 1994b) function through an unusual mechanism: they are able to recruit a single gp 130 chain but fail to induce its homodimerization, thus lacking signalling capacity. Furthermore, their use in solution binding/immuno1948  precipitation reactions distinguished two distinct areas on IL-6 (sites 2 and 3), each of which is responsible for the independent binding of two gpl30 chains with different orientations. This provides a molecular explanation for how the cytokine recruits two gpl30 molecules, causes their dimerization and promotes signalling. An important issue is what are the driving forces that bring about this process. Our study provides some important clues. Both site 2 and site 3 on IL-6 are unable to establish stable interactions with gpl30 in the absence of IL-6Rax. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that these sites on IL-6 are 'activated' by conformational changes upon interaction with IL-6Rcx, it may be that portions of the IL-6Ra surface are annexed, thus extending the interaction surfaces between gpl30 and the IL-6-IL6Rx complex. We favour the latter explanation because this is the mechanism operating in receptor assembly of GH, where it has been shown that when this hormone binds to its receptor, no major structural rearrangements occur (Ultsch et al., 1994). Experiments using combinations of IL-6 variants in site 2 or site 3 and the receptor variant Mutl strengthen our choice: site 2 in IL-6 plus residues 280/281 in IL-6Rx are projected towards the same gp 130 molecule and together form a single combined site, whereas the other site is composed of a combination of site 3 and a still unidentified part of IL-6Ra. In each combined site the alteration of either the IL-6 or the IL6Rax component causes loss of binding to the facing gpl30 chain. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the receptor complex assembled in vitro contains not only two gpl30 chains but also two IL-6 and two IL-6Rx molecules. We therefore propose that the active receptor complex is made of a hexamer with an IL-6-IL-6Ragpl3O stoichiometry of 2:2:2. Based on previous 3-D modelling predictions and on the data presented in this paper, we present a schematic topological model for this new structure that can be called the 'hexameric IL-6 receptor complex'. The model is shown in Figure 9 both from a side view and projected along two planes. Two distinct regions have indeed to be defined in the hexamer: the top part in which the cytokine is located, and the bottom part formed by the second subdomains of the CBDs of both IL-6Rax and gpl30 in which direct contacts are established by the receptor chains. Although it is possible to consider the hexamer as formed by the clustering of two GH-like trimers juxtaposed in inverted orientations, we think that this is highly reductive because we believe that the hexamer is 'held' together by several interaction surfaces, some of which have already been identified and others of which can only be hypothesized. Many additional contacts could in fact be envisaged at both levels, for example direct interaction between the two IL-6 molecules. It is interesting to note that affinity cross-linking experiments on IL-6-responsive cells with iodinated IL-6 revealed the presence of IL-6 dimers, either alone or associated with an IL-6Roc molecule (Rose-John et al., 1991; D'Alessandro et al., 1993; Stoyan et al., 1993). However, none of our site 2 and site 3 IL-6 variants map in the putative cytokine-cytokine contact surface because they do not show selective impairment of IL-6 dimerization in immunoprecipitation reactions (G.Paonessa and R.Graziani, unpublished results). From  IL-6 receptor complex assembly  Top  Fig. 9. Model of the hexameric IL-6 receptor complex. Shown are a side view of the IL-6 hexameric receptor complex (left) and two cross-sections through the complex (right): one that includes the bound cytokine (top), and a second (bottom) formed by the second subdomains of the CBDs of both IL-6Ro and gp130 where only interactions between the receptor molecules are postulated to occur. At this level, two asterisks in the IL-6Ra indicate the hypothetical location of the amino acids H280 and D281 mutagenized in the IL-6Ra variant Mut1. For IL-6, numbers identify the sites of interaction with the various receptor components (sites 1-3). The colour code is blue for gpl30, green for IL-6RCa and pink for IL-6. For the receptors, only the part corresponding to their CBDs is shown.  the model, it could also be expected that gp 130 has at least two sites of interaction with IL-6 and two with IL-6Ra, and targeted mutagenesis of the extracellular region of gpl 30 should be very useful in supporting this. Lastly, homodimerization contact surfaces between two gp 130 and/or two IL-6Rx could be located at the bottom level formed by the second subdomains of the CBDs. While this manuscript was being prepared it was reported that the incubation of purified IL-6-IL-6Rax complexes with soluble gp130 produced in CHO cells gave rise to complexes whose molecular weight is compatible only with the formation of hexamers with a 2:2:2 stoichiometry (Ward et al., 1994). Therefore, identical conclusions have been obtained using a different approach. The use of wild-type molecules only did not, however, provide any information about the topological relationship of the various molecules in the assembled receptor complex (Ward et al., 1994). The hexamer is a novel type of receptor complex first discovered for IL-6. We propose, based on sequence homology data, that hexamers could be a common feature of receptor complexes assembled by other cytokines whose specific ligand binding receptors are predicted to be structurally and functionally similar to IL-6Rcx. Among these are ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (Davis et al., 1991) and probably also IL- 11 (Hilton et al., 1994). Indeed, immunoprecipitations performed using a strategy similar to that described in this paper for IL-6 strongly suggest that the dimerization of the CNTF-CNTF-R complex takes place in solution (A.De Serio, R.Graziani, R.Laufer, G.Ciliberto and G.Paonessa, manuscript in pre paration).  Interestingly, IL- 12 (referred to also as natural killer cell stimulatory factor), which is by itself always found as a disulfide-linked heterodimer between a 35 kDa polypeptide related to IL-6 (Merberg et al., 1992) and a 40 kDa polypeptide related to IL-6Roa (Gearing and Cosman, 1991), could also form a 2+2 receptor complex with its receptor subunit IL-12R which is strongly homologous to gpl3O (Chua et al., 1994). Because IL-6 binds first to a receptor chain that does not have any direct role in cell signalling, it is tempting to speculate that the active cytokine is indeed the IL-6-IL-6Rcx complex; this is also supported by the evidence that soluble forms of IL-6Rax act as potentiators of cytokine activity (Taga et al., 1989) and are present at high levels in the circulation (Honda et al., 1992). Hexamer formation could thus be a common biological strategy which evolved to ensure the formation of high-affinity binding sites and firmly trap cytokines and/or growth factors into active configurations.  Materials and methods Tagging and expression of the soluble receptors Mutant cDNA coding for soluble forms of gpl3O tagged at the Cterminus with myc (Evan et al., 1985) or FLAG (Hopp et al., 1988) epitopes were generated by inserting double-strand oligonucleotides at the EcoRI site of gp 130 located around the codons for amino acids 605606 (E-F). The resulting C-termini, were in the case of myc, E(605)FEEQKLISEEDL-Stop (hereafter called sgpl3O-myc) and, in the case of FLAG, E(605)-FDYKDDDDK-Stop (hereafter called sgpl30-FLAG). Mutant cDNA coding for soluble forms of IL-6Rax with and without myc tag epitope at the C-terminus were generated by PCR using suitable oligonucleotides. In the case of untagged sIL-6Ra (hereafter called sIL6Ra), a stop codon was inserted after proline 322. In the case of  1949  G.Paonessa et al. sIL-6Rax tagged with myc, myc epitope was inserted after proline 322 followed by a stop codon; the resulting C-terminus was P(322)GGEQKLISEEDL-Stop (hereafter called sIL-6Ramyc). The cDNAs of the soluble receptor variants sgpl3O-myc, sgpl3O-FLAG, sIL-6Rax and sIL-6Raxmyc were cloned into the BamHI site of the baculovirus expression vector pBluBac III (Invitrogen). The generation of recombinant baculovirus expressing variants of gpl3O and IL-6Ra was performed with MAXBAC kit (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The expression of cold receptors was accomplished by infecting High Five cells (Invitrogen) with a high titre stock of recombinant virus at a m.o.i. of 5-10. After 2 h the inoculum was removed and the cells were incubated at 27°C in SF-900 II medium (Gibco) until all cells detached from the plate (48-72 h). Medium was collected and centrifuged, and the supernatant was assayed by Western blot for recombinant protein production. (1990) Structure-function analysis of human IL-6. J. Immunol., 145, 561-568.

Semi-confluent High Five cells in a 6 cm plate were infected (m.o.i. of 5-10) with high titre recombinant baculovirus. After 36-48 h, medium was replaced with 2 ml of methionine-free Grace's insect medium and incubated at 27°C for 1 h. The medium was then replaced with 1.5 ml of methionine-free Grace's insect medium containing 50 gt of TRAN[35S]LABEL (sp. act. &amp;gt;1000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml; ICN Biomedical Inc.) and incubated for a further 2 h. Medium was then collected, cell debris centrifuged and the supernatant used for the experiments.  Immunoprecipitations Immunoprecipitation experiments were typically performed according to the following protocols. 500 gl baculovirus supernatant expressing myc-tagged receptors and 5 gg wild-type IL-6, variant IL-6 or IL-6myc were incubated with 4 gu anti-myc 9E 10 monoclonal antibody (Evan et al., 1985) or 1 ,ug monoclonal antibody IL-6- 16 (CLB, The Netherlands) plus 40 gl 50% slurry in PBS of protein A-Sepharose (referred to hereafter as PAS; Pharmacia) overnight at 4°C. After washing three times with PBSTB (I X PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2% Brij 96), the Sepharose beads were incubated with other receptor(s) and/or cytokine (for further details see legends to the respective figures) for at least 12 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed three times with PBSTB, resuspended in SDS loading buffer, heated for 5 min at 95°C and subjected to SDS-PAGE.  Generation and expression of IL-6 variants Generation and expression of IL-6 variants were performed exactly as described previously (Savino et al., 1 994b). For the amino acid numbering of IL-6 see Savino et al. (1994a). IL-6 tagged with myc epitope at the N-terminus (IL-6myc) was generated by PCR using suitable oligonucleotides; it was cloned in pT7.7 vector (Studier et al., 1990). The resulting sequence of the N-terminus is the following: Met-EQKLISEEDL-wtIL-6, where the first amino acid of IL-6 is represented by valine in position 2. 35S-labelling of wild-type IL-6 was performed with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) according to the supplier's instructions.  In vitro receptor binding assays and bioassays In vitro receptor binding assays and bioassays on HepG2 and XG-1 cell lines were performed exactly as described previously (Savino et al., 1994b).

																												<Abstract>The Ras and Raf1 proto-oncogenes transduce extracellular signals that promote cell growth. Cdc25 phosphatases activate the cell division cycle by dephosphorylation of critical threonine and tyrosine residues within the cyclin-dependent kinases. We show here that Cdc25 phosphatase associates with raf1 in somatic mammalian cells and in meiotic frog oocytes. Furthermore, Cdc25 phosphatase can be activated in vitro in a Raf1-dependent manner. We suggest that activation of the cell cycle by the Ras/Raf1 pathways might be mediated in part by Cdc25.</Abstract>

																												<Abstract>The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is a target of viral oncoproteins. To explore the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular proteins, we have searched cDNA libraries for Rb-binding proteins. We report here the cloning of a cDNA for the protein RIZ from rat and human cells. RIZ is a 250-kDa nuclear protein containing eight zinc-finger motifs. It contains an Rb-binding motif that shares an antigenic epitope with the C terminus of E1A. A domain is conserved between RIZ and the PRDI-BF1/Blimp-1 differentiation factor. Other motifs of RIZ include putative GTPase and SH3 (src homology domain 3) domains. RIZ is preferentially expressed in both adult and embryonic rat neuroendocrine tissues. It is also expressed in human retinoblastoma cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined. While the function of RIZ is not yet clear, its structure and pattern of expression suggest a role for RIZ in transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of retinoblastoma.</Abstract>

<BodyText>Cell, Vol. 81, 505-512,  May 19, 1995, Copyright  0 1995 by Cell Press  FADD, a Novel Death Domain-Containing Interacts with the Death Domain of Fas and Initiates Apoptosis Arul M. Chinnaiyan,' Karen O'Rourke; Muneesh Tewari, and Vishva M. Dixit Department of Pathology University of Michigan Medical School Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109  Protein,  Summary Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast twohybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fasand Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the Ipr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1fMonverting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas. Introduction Programmed cell death (PCD) is a physiological process essential to the normal development and homeostatic maintenanceof multicellular organisms (reviewed by Vaux et al., 1994; Ellis et al., 1991). Apoptosis, often equated with PCD, refers to the morphological alterations exhibited by "actively" dying cells that include cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and chromatin condensation (Cohen, 1993). In contrast, necrosis, sometimes referred to as accidental cell death, is defined by the swelling and lysis of cells that are exposed to toxic stimuli. Though the morphological features of cell death are well described, the molecular mechanisms behind apoptosis remain undefined. Recent work on PCD in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans showed that the ted-3 gene is required for apoptosis (Yuan et al., 1993). Sequence analysis revealed that CED3 is similar to the mammalian interleukin-18 (IL-18)-converting enzyme (ICE) (Yuan et al., 1993), which is a cysteine proteinase involved in the processing and activation of pro-IL-l 8 to the active cytokine (Cerretti et al., 1992; Thornberry et al., 1992). Overexpression of ICE in mammalian cells induced apoptosis, suggesting that ICE, or a related protease, may be an essential component of the cell death pathway (Miura et al., 1993). Although a CED-3-like protease is suspected to be a distal effector of the mammalian cell death pathway, the proximal components that lead to its activation remain to be identified. Two cell surface cytokine receptors, Fasl APO-l antigen and the receptor for tumor necrosis factor *The first two authors contributed equally to this work.  (TNF), have been shown to trigger apoptosis by natural ligands or specific agonist antibodies (Baglioni, 1992; Yonehara et al., 1989; ltoh et al., 1991; Trauth et al., 1989). Mice carrying a point mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of Fasexhibit a lupus-like lymphoproliferativeautoimmune disorder (/or), (Watanabe-Fukunaga et al., 1992), and the Fas-mediated cell death pathway has been recently implicated in the activation-induced death of T cells (Dhein et al., 1995; Brunner et al., 1995; Ju et al., 1995). While the main activity of Fas is to trigger cell death, the TNF receptor (TNFR) can signal an array of diverse activities such as fibroblast proliferation, resistance to chlamidiae, and synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (Tartaglia and Goeddel, 1992). Recent work in our laboratory suggests that the stimulation of Fas or the TNFR triggers the activation of a common component of the cell death pathway. CrmA, a poxvirus gene product, was shown to potently block both Fas- and TNF-induced cell death (Tewari and Dixit, 1995). Interestingly, the only reported target for CrmA is the CED-3 homolog ICE (Ray et al., 1992) suggesting that ICE, or an ICE-like protease, is the common effector of cytokine receptor-mediated cell death. The activation of Fas and TNFR is caused by receptor aggregation mediated by the respective ligands or agonist antibodies. The signal is thought to be transduced by clustering of the intracellular domain (Boldin et al., 1995; Song et al., 1994), which encompasses a region that is significantly conserved in the Fas antigen as well as in TNFR-1 (Tartaglia et al., 1993; ltoh and Nagata, 1993). This shared "death domain" suggests that both receptors interact with a related set of signal transduction molecules that, thus far, remain unidentified. Here, we report the molecular cloning and characterization of FADD, a Fas-associating protein with a novel death domain. The specific interaction of Fas and FADD is due to the association of their respective homologous death domains. Remarkably similar to Fas-induced killing, overexpression of FADD induces apoptosis that is inhibitable by CrmA. Taken together, our results suggest that FADD is a component of the Fas-mediated cell death pathway. Results Isolation of FADD The yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of Fas. An expression vector was constructed by fusing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to the cytoplasmic tail of the human Fas antigen (GAL4bd-Fas). This bait plasmid was cotrans formed in yeast with a prey plasmid containing a human B cell cDNA expression library fused to the GAL4 activation domain. Seventeen positive clones were obtained from 2 x 1 O6transformants screened. To determine the specificity of interaction, plasmids containing the activation domain fusion proteins were recovered from the putative positive clones and cotransformed with GAL4bd-Fas and control heterologous baits. Two clones (8 and 15) were  Cell 506  A-TNFR-1  894  TNFR-1  CD28  FAS-FD8  CD40  Figure  2. Sequence  Analysis  of FADD  and Its Novel  Death  Domain  FAS Figure 1.

FADD is a Novel Protein with a Death Domain Clones 8 and 15 isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screen were found to contain overlapping sequence fused to the GAL4 activation domain in the same reading frame. To obtain a full-length coding sequence, a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) library was screened with a cDNA insert obtained from clone 15. Two independent clones yielded a 1.6 kb cDNA containing an open reading frame that begins with an initiator methionine conforming to Kozak's consensus (Kozak, 1989) and that ends 625 nt later at an Opal codon. Given the presence of an in-frame stop codon 130 bp upstream of the initiator methionine and the size of the transcript (1.6 kb; Figure 3) it is likely that Figure 2A represents the full-length coding sequence. This gene encodes a previously undescribed protein of 208 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 23.3 kDa, designated FADD. A BLAST search revealed that residues 11 l-170 of FADD matched residues 233-292 of rat Fas antigen (rFas, p = 0.0012) and shared 27% identity (51% of the amino acids were conserved). This region in the cytoplasmic domain of rFas corresponds to the death domain, a region of homology shared by both Fas and TNFR-1 that signals cell death (Tartaglia et al., 1993; ltoh and Nagata, 1993). Dependent upon the alignment and boundaries selected, the death domains of FADD, Fas, and TNFR-1 share 25%-30% identity (Figure 28). When conservative amino acid substitutions are included, the homologies approach 50%. These values are consistent with those previously reported for the death domain homology between TNFR-1 and Fas (Tartaglia et al., 1993; ltoh and Nagata, 1993).

A corresponding inactivating mutation also exists in TNFR-1, L351+N351 (Tartaglia et al., 1993). Tissue Distribution of FADD Northern blot analysis revealed that FADD is constitutively expressed in many fetal and adult human tissues (Figure 3). The mRNA transcript is approximately 1.6 kb, consistent with the size of the cDNA clones isolated from the HUVEC library. In Vitro Association of FADD and Fas To confirm the interaction observed in yeast, radiolabeled in vitro translated FADD was precipitated with various glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Figures 4A and 4B). As predicted, FADD specifically associated with GST-Fas but not GST, GST-Fas-FD8, or GST-Fas-LPR, which contains the cytoplasmic domain of the functionally inactive point mutant of Fas (Itoh and Nagata, 1993). A very weak interaction was observed between FADD and TNFR-1. Interestingly, relative to its association with GST-Fas, FADD strongly interacted with GST-Fas-FD5, which is a 15 amino acid C-terminal deletion mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity (Itoh and Nagata, 1993). Similar results were obtained when detergent lysates of 293Tcells expressing FADD were precipitated with the various GST fusion proteins (Figure 4C). Coimmunoprecipitation of FADD and Fas To demonstrate the interaction of FADD and Fas in vivo, 293T cells were transiently transfected with HA epitope FADD:  507  A Fas-Associating  Protein  with a Novel  Death  Domain  Figure 3.

Expression of the FLAG-tagged constructs was shown by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG (a-FLAG) antibody (Figure 5B). Likewise, immunoprecipitation with anti-HA (a-HA) antibody showed expression of HA-FADD, and as expected, FLAG-Fas and FLAG-Fas-FD5 individually coprecipitated, while the functionally inactive mutants FLAG-Fas-FD8 and FLAG-Fas-LPR did not (Figure 5C). The a-HA immunoprecipitates were dissociated and subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with a-FLAG antibody. Consistent with results of the primary immunoprecipitation (with a-HA), a double immunoprecipitation with a-HA followed by a-FLAG confirmed the presence of FLAG-Fas and FLAG-Fas-FD5 in the original immune complexes (Figure 5D). The Death Domain of FADD Interacts with the Death Domain of Fas Previous studies have reported that the death domains of TNFR-1 and Fas self-associate (Boldin et al., 1995). The two clones (8 and 15) isolated in our two-hybrid screen (using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas as bait) did not contain various portions of the N-terminus of wild-type FADD (Figure 2A). The shortest of the two, clone 8, is missing the N-terminal 40 amino acids, suggesting that the C-terminal half of FADD, which contains the death domain, interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of Fas. More specifically, our results show that FADD interacts with the death domain of Fas, since it fails to associate with Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8, a point mutant and deletion mutant, respectively, of the Fas death domain. Thus, it is reasonable to propose that the death domain of FADD is interacting with its homologous counterpart in Fas. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a point mutant of FADD (FADDmt) in which V121 is altered to an asparagine. This mutation corresponds to the inactivating Ipr mutation (V238eN238) of Fas and the L351 -+N351 mutation of TNFR-1. 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs containing AU1 epitope-tagged FADD (AUl-FADD) and AUl-FADDmt. Detergent lysates were prepared and subsequently precipitated with GST, GST-Fas, and GST-Fas-LPR immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Figure 6). As predicted, AUl Figure  4.

(C) 293T cells were transfected with HA epitope-tagged FADD (HAFADD) and metabolically labeled with ["Sjmethionine and cysteine. Detergent lysates were prepared and incubated with the various GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washing, the complexed beads were dissociated and immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA (a-HA) antibody that should recognize HA-FADD. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (upper panel). The respective GST fusion proteins are shown as in (B) (lower panel).  FADD bound GST-Fas and not GST or GST-Fas-LPR, while, in contrast, AUl-FADDmt failed to bind any of the GST fusions. Taken together, our results suggest that a death domain to death domain interaction is responsible for the association of FADD and Fas. Overexpression of FADD Initiates Apoptosis That Is Suppressed by CrmA To study the functional role of FADD, we chose MCF7 cells, a breast carcinoma cell line that expresses Fas and is sensitive to Fas-induced killing in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Tewari and Dixit, 1995). Two stably transfected and previouslycharacterized clonal cell lines of MCF7 were used in our study: one expresses CrmA, a viral serpin inhibitor that has been shown to potently block Fas-mediated cell death (Tewari and Dixit, 1995) and a corresponding control cell line expresses an inactive CrmA mutant (Tewari et al., submitted). The mutant CrmA possesses a single amino acid substitution within its reactive site loop, abolishing its ability to inhibit Fas- and TNF-mediated apoptosis. The re Cell 508  A CL..

The MCF7I mutant CrmA cell lines expressing FADD @-galactosidase-positive blue cells) displayed morphological alteration typical of adherent cells undergoing apoptosis, becoming rounded, condensed, and detaching from the dish (Figure 7A, left). The nuclei of the rounded MCF7 cells exhibited apoptotic morphology indistinguishable from MCF7 cells treated with anti-Fas antibody in the presence of cycloheximideasassessed bypropidium iodidestaining (data not shown). In contrast, MCF7/CrmA cells transfected with FADD were significantly protected from cell death and the accompanying morphological alterations of apoptosis (Figure 7A, right). A quantitative representation of this data is shown in Table 1. FADD-induced apoptosis is not peculiar to MCF7 cells, since a similar phenotype was observed in the B cell lymphoma cell line, BJAB, which is exquisitely sensitive to anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis (Tewari and Dixit, 1995). CrmA-expressing and vector control BJAB cell lines (Tewari and Dixit, 1995) were transfected with the pCMV f3-galactosidase reporter in the presence or absence of an equimolar amount of an expression construct encoding FADD. As expected, expression of P-galactosidase alone in both the CrmA and vector clones did not induce apoptotic cell death as assessed by propidium iodide staining of nuclei of f&amp;galactosidase-positive cells (data not shown). In contrast, however, the vector control cell line cotransfected with pCMV f3-galactosidase and pcDNA3 AUlFADD exhibited prominent apoptotic morphology including chromatin condensation and cellular shrinkage. More importantly, FADD-induced apoptosis, like Fas-induced apoptosis, was inhibited in the CrmA-expressing line. In the vector control lines, over 90% of the transfected cells  AUI-FAOD  AM-FADDmt  Figure Death  8.

As a control, expression of AU1 TRAFl (Rothe et al., 1994) and HACD40bp (Hu et al., 1994), which a8sociate with the cytoplasmic domains of TNFR-2 and CD40, respectively, revealed less than 10% apoptotic morphology in either the CrmA or vector cell lines. Delineation of the Death Effector Domain of FADD Deletion mutants of FADD were constructed to determine the region responsible for initiating the cell death program (Figure 78). As described above, MCF7 cells expressing  FADD: 509  A Fas-Associating  Protein  with a Novel  Death  Domain  Cdl  + *  CrmA and mutant CrmA were transiently transfected with the various FADD mutant expression vectors. Interestingly, overexpression of FADDmt, a point mutant that fails to bind Fas, still induced cell death that was CrmA inhibitable and, in fact, was slightly more potent than wild-type FADD (81% versus 72% apoptotic cells). A FADD mutant (N-FADD) containing only 117 N-terminal amino acids was able to trigger cell death (Table 1; Figure 78). Since a large portion of the death domain is absent from N-FADD, it is not surprising that it, like FADDmt, fails to associate with the cytoplasmic domain of Fas (data not shown). N-terminal deletions of FADD (NFD-2, NFD-3, and NFD-4) attenuated its ability to induce cell death (Table 1; Figure 78). This analysis suggests that, whereas the Fasinteracting domain is in the C-terminal half of FADD, the death effector domain lies in its N-terminal portion. Discussion FADD was identified as a novel protein that associates specifically with the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid screen (Figure 1). A BLAST search using the amino acid sequence of FADD revealed a stretch of 80 amino acids that were significantly homologous to the death domain of Fas (Figure 28). When this region of FADD was masked, the remaining sequences did not match any proteins in the data base. Interestingly, BLAST searches using the death domains of FADD, Fas, and TNFR-1 revealed a significant homology to the family of ankyrins (p &amp;lt; 0.001 for all three death domains) that mediate interaction between integral membrane components and cytoskeletal elements. More specifically, the respective death domains aligned with approximately 80 amino acids of the negative regulatory domain of ankyrin. A previous study reported that this region of ankyrin is homolo Figure  MCF7  7.

Why ankyrin contains a "death domain" remains unclear, but presumably this region is acting as a protein interaction domain. In vitro and in vivo binding studies show that FADD specifically associates with the death domain of Fas, confirming the results of the yeast interaction assay. FADD failed to interact with Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8, a nonsignaling point mutant and deletion mutant, respectively, of the Fas death domain. Interestingly, upon deletion of the negative regulatory domain of Fas, an enhanced interaction with FADD was observed. Hence, a correlation exists between the cell-killing activity of the various Fas mutants and their association with FADD (Figure 5A). A weak association between FADD and TNFR-1 was observed in vitro (Figure 48). In addition, b-galactosidase filter assays of yeast cotransformed with GAUbd-Fas and GAL4ad-FADD turned blue within 1 hr, while those cotransformed with GAL4bd-TNFR-1 and GAL4ad-FADD turned blue overnight (the other cotransformed heterologous baits remained unchanged). If the weak interaction between FADD and TNFR-1 observed in yeast and in vitro proves to be significant, this would correlate with the relative potencies of Fas-dependent cell death and TNF-dependent cytotoxicity (Clement and Stamenkovic, 1994) and, furthermore, would suggest that TNFR-1 could interact with and utilize FADD or a FADD-like molecule as a proximal transducer of the death signal. Having shown that FADD specifically binds the death domain of Fas, we wished to identify the corresponding interaction domain in FADD. Previous studies have shown that death domains have a propensity to self-associate (Boldin et al., 1995). It was thus reasonable to propose that the death domain of FADD was interacting with its homologous counterpart in Fas. As predicted, a point mutation in the death domain of FADD abrogated its association with Fas (Figure 8). In addition, a deletion encompassing the death domain of FADD (N-FADD) also abolished binding to Fas (data not shown). Our results support a model in which a death domain to death domain interaction is responsible for the binding of FADD to Fas. Once the in vitro and in vivo association of FADD and Fas was established, we proceeded to determine a functional role for this novel Fas-binding protein. BJAB cells treated with a-Fas antibody undergo apoptosis within hours (M. T. and V. M. D., unpublished data), a time frame similar to FADD-induced killing. Likewise, CrmA-expressing BJAB cells are resistant to both Fas- and FADDinduced killing. To ensure that the induction of cell death by FADD was not a peculiarity of one cell type, we also examined the effects of FADD on another Fas-sensitive cell line, MCF7. As was seen in BJAB cells, overexpression of FADD in MCF7 cells induced apoptosis that was CrmA inhibitable and indistinguishable from Fas-induced killing. Deletional analysis of FADD localized the death effector domain of FADD to its N-terminal portion (Figure 78). In fact, the N-terminal amino acids (l-l 17) are sufficient to cause death and deletions of the N-terminus attenuate the cell-killing ability of FADD. In addition, the data refutes the  possibility that FADD causes cell death by simply aggregating the Fas antigen intracellularly, since both N-FADD and FADDmt trigger apoptosis without binding Fas. We are currently investigating the intriguing possibility that the C-terminus of FADD can act as a dominant negative regulator of Fas-induced signaling. Overexpression of FADD induces apoptosis in a Fas ligand-independent fashion. A model consistent with our data is that endogenous FADD is associated with the death domain of the Fas receptor in a "resting" cell. However, upon ligand-mediated oligomerization of the Fas antigen, intracellular aggregation of the Fas death domains might displace FADD, triggering a death response, presumably mediated via the N-terminus of FADD interacting with a downstream component of the cell death pathway. Experimental Procedures Fas-FDB. TNFR-1, A-TNFR-1, CD40, and CD28 were obtained by PCR and cloned in-frame, as confirmed by sequencing, into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4bd) vector pASlCYH2. Full-length A20 and B94 were similarly cloned into the bait vector. GAL4bd-Fas was cotransformed with a prey plasmid containing a human B cell cDNA expression library fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4ad) in the PACT plasmid. A more detailed account of the plasmids used and the procedure for the yeast twohybrid system can be found in our previous work (Hu et al., 1994). DNA Sequencing and Data Base Searching Double-stranded piasmid template was sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method using modified T7 DNA poly merase (Sequenase, United States Biochemical Corporation). Manual sequencing was confirmed by subsequent automated sequencing. Network BLAST searches were conducted using the NCBI on-line service. Sequences were compared using the MegAlign (DNASTAR) software. cDNA Cloning A random-primed cDNA library was constructed in the pcDNA1 vector (Invitrogen)from TNF-cycioheximide-treated human umbilicalvein endotheliai cell poly(A)' RNA. Colonies (5 x 105) were screened with a %P random-labeled Xhoi restriction fragment of the yeast prey piasmid encoding GAL4ad-FADD (clone 15) using standard techniques (Sambrook et al., 1989) Northern Blot Analysis Adult and fetal human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized, according to the instructions of the manufacturer, using radiolabeled cDNA insert obtained from an Xhol digestion of the yeast prey plasmid encoding GAL4ad-FADD (clone 15). Expression Vectors FADD was cloned into a modified pcDNA3 expression vector (lnvitrogen) in which an HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) had previously been placed downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer (pcDNA3 HA-FADD). In addition, an AU1 epitope (DTYRYI)-tagged FADD and mutants were made with PCR primers encoding the epitope and using the FADD cDNA as template (pcDNA3 AUl-FADD). FLAG (DYKDDDDK)-tagged constructs of Fas and mutants were aisc made in pcDNA3 using full-length Fas as a template. The 5' FLAG PCR primer was engineered to encode a FLAG epitope five amino acids downstream of the the putative signal sequence site of Fas and is as follows: AAG CCT GGT ACC ATG CTG GGC ATC TGG ACC CTC CTA CCT CTG G-IT C-i-r ACG TCT GlT GCT AGA TTA TCG TCC AAA GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG AGT GTT AAT GCC CAA GTG.

Fas-LPR was made by site-directed mutagenesis using a two-step PCR protocol (Higuchi et al., 1988) and cloned into pGSTag. The V238+N238 mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis. The pGSTag constructs were then transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Studier, 1991). GST and GST fusions were prepared using published procedures (Studier, 1991), and the recombinant proteins immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads (Harper et al., 1993). Labeled FADD was prepared by in vitro transcription/translation using TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system from Promega according to the instructions of the manufacturer, using pcDNA3 HAFADD as template. Following translation, equal amounts of total 3SS-labeled reticulocyte lysate were diluted into 150 VI of GST binding buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.61, 120 mM NaCI, 1% Brij) and incubated for 2 hr at 4OC with the various GST fusion proteins complexed to beads, following which the beads were pelleted by pulse centrifugation, washed three times in GST buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Bound proteins were visualized following autoradiography at -6OOC. Lysates of FADD or FADDmt-transfected 293T cells were processed as above, except that the GST binding buffer also had 10% glycerol and a protease inhibitor cocktail. For some experiments, the complexed GST beads were dissociated by boiling in PBS plus 1% SDS, diluted IO-fold in PBS containing 1% deoxycholate, and subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis. Transfection, Metabolic Labeling, and lmmunoprecipltation Analysis These were performed essentially as described previously (O'Rourke et al., 1992). For reimmunoprecipitation analysis, the initial immune complex was dissociated by boiling in PBS plus 1% SDS, diluted lofold in PBS containing 1% deoxycholate, and subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation analysis. Functional Assay and lmmunocytochemistry BJAB and MCF7 clonal cell lines stably transfected with either vector, CrmA, or CrmA mutant expression constructs were utilized (Tewari and Dixit, 1995; Tewari et al., submitted).

After 12 hr, cells were cytocentrifuged, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% TritonlPBS, blocked with horse serum, and incubated with rabbit antib-galactosidase (1:200 dilution, Cappel) for 1 hr. The cells were subsequently washed with PBS, incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (1:200 dilution, Vector Laboratories) for 20 min, washed with PBS, and incubated with Avidin-FITC (I:100 dilution, Vector Laboratories) for 20 min. The nuclei were stained with a 10 pglml solution of propidium iodide(Sigma)for 10 min. Cellswerevisualized byfluorescence microscopy using a FITC range barrier filter cube.

Transfections were carried out in 1 ml of OptiMEM Minimal Media (GIBCO-BRL) and incubated for 5 hr after which 1 ml of serumcontaining growth media was added. After 24 hr, cells were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with X-Gal for 4 hr. Cells were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy.  M.

Stanger,`t Philip Leder,`t Emily Kim,t* and Brian Seedt* *Howard Hughes Medical institute tDepartment of Genetics Harvard Medical School Boston, Massachusetts 02115 *Department of Molecular Biology Massachusetts General Hospital Boston, Massachusetts 02114 Tae-Ho Lee,t* Disruption of Fas expression or function in lymphoproliferation (/or) mutant mice leads to a progressive lymphadenopathy and autoimmune syndrome resembling human systemic lupus erythematosus (Watanabe-Fukunaga et al., 1992b). The residual cytotoxic activity of T cells derived from perforin-deficient mice is also dependent on the presence of at least one wild-type allele of the Ipr locus (Kagi et al., 1994; Kojimaet al., 1994; Lowin et al., 1994). Thus, the ability of Fas to induce cell death is important for the maintenance of at least two immunological processes in vivo: peripheral tolerance to self (Singer and Abbas, 1994; Crispe, 1994) and calcium-independent T cell cytotoxicity (reviewed by Henkart, 1994). The mechanism by which Fas induces cell death is unknown, but it requires multivalent cross-linking of the receptor (Dhein et al., 1992) and is facilitated by concurrent inhibition of RNA or protein synthesis in some cell types. Other factors have been reported to modulate Fas activity (Klas et al., 1993), and under certain circumstances, Fas is capable of signaling activation rather than death (Alderson et al., 1993). Anti-Fas antibodies and TNF are both capable of signaling cell death in vitro with similar kinetics (Yonehara et al., 1989; ltoh and Nagata, 1993) and among members of the NGFITNF receptor family, Fas and TNFRl share the most significant cytoplasmic homology. Deletion and mutational analyses have led to the identification of sequences within Fas that are required for the cell death response (Itoh and Nagata, 1993). It has been proposed that a death domain contained in a region of similarity between Fas and TNFRI is essential for the initiation of apoptosis by both molecules, perhaps through an interaction with other intracellular proteins (Tartaglia et al., 1993a). To study the events elicited by Fas ligation, we have exploited a yeast protein interaction system to identify a novel protein that interacts with the Fas cytoplasmic domain. This protein, which we have named RIP (for receptor interacting protein), contains a death domain homology region at its C-terminus and a kinase domain at its N-terminus. Overexpression of RIP leads to morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. The ability of RIP to associate with the Fas intracellular domain in yeast and to promote apoptotic changes upon overexpression in mammalian cells suggests it may be an important element in the signal transduction machinery that mediates programmed cell death. Results Identification of cDNAs Encoding Protein Domains That Bind Fas A cDNA library screen for proteins that interact with the intracellular domain of Fas was conducted with the help of a yeast genetic selection system (Gyuris et al., 1993; Zervos et al., 1993). A cDNA segment comprising virtually the entire cytoplasmic domain of human Fas (residues  Summary Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor FaslAPO-1 (COSS) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the ~55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFRl) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine /pFg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein klnases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFRl intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein.  Although regulated cell death is known to be essential for the orderly development of metazoan organisms and is crucial to the proper functioning of the immune system in higher vertebrates, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which cell death programs are executed. One important mediator of immunologically relevant cell death processes is the Fas antigen/APO-l (CD95), originally identified as the target of monoclonal antibodies that could kill multiple cell types (Trauth et al., 1989; Yonehara et al., 1989). cDNA cloning and sequence analysis (Itoh et al., 1991; Watanabe-Fukunaga et al., 1992a; Oehm et al., 1992) showed Fas to be a member of a family of transmembrane receptors that includes the low affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor, the tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRl and TNFRP), and a variety of immune cell receptors including CD40, 0X40, CD30, CD27, and 4-1 BB(forreviewseeSmith et al., 1994). Several members of this family besides Fas have been shown to regulate or induce cell death, in particular the ~55 TNFR (TNFRl) (Tartaglia et al., 1991, 1993b) and the ~75 TNFR (TNFR2) (Heller et al., 1992, 1993; Clement and Stamenkovic, 1994).  Cdl 514  Figure  1. Specificity  of RIP Interactions  in Yeast  (A) RIP-Fas and Fas-Fas interactions. Cells of the S. cerevisiae strain EGY48lpRB1840 were sequentially transformed with the indicated L&amp;&amp;-fusion plasmid and either the Act-Fas or the Act-RIP library isolate. Independent colonies arising from the activator plasmid transformations were streaked on Ura- His Trp- plates containing X-Gal, galactose, and raffinose and photographed using a red filter. (B) Quantitative P-gal assay. Three colonies from each Act-RIPILexAfusion protein pair were used to inoculate a galactose-containing liquid culture. The P-gal activity of lysates prepared from each culture was measured and normalized to the total protein concentration of the lysate. 5 units (nmoleslminlmg protein) represents the limit of detection of b-gal activity in this system. (C) Pairwise association between LexA-Fas deletion variants and ActFas or Act-RIP. The indicated yeast strains were constructed by transformation, and the production of B-gal was tested by a chromogenic colony assay using X-Gal. The extent of color development of individual colony streaks was scored visually, with ++++ indicating dark blue and - indicating the growth of white colonies only; +I- indicates the presence of faint blue flecks in some of the colonies bearing the indicated AcULexA pair.  192-329 of the Fas precursor) was fused to the 3' end of the coding region for the bacterial repressor LexA, and a yeast expression plasmid containing this gene fusion was introduced into a reporter strain harboring the Saccharomyces cerevisiae LEU2 and Escherichia coli P-galactosidase (B-gal) coding sequences under the control of a synthetic promoter bearing LexA-binding sites. The resulting  yeast strain was transformed with a transcriptional activator fusion protein library prepared from mRNA isolated from the Jurkat (human T cell leukemia) cell line, which is known to undergo apoptosis when subjected to treatment with anti-Fas antibody. Transformants were plated on selective (Leu-deficient) plates containing galactose, which induces the GAL 7 promoter that directs transcription of the library insert. Leu prototrophs were transferred to plates containing X-Gal and galactose, and colonies giving a dark blue color were recovered and analyzed further. To test the specificity of the interaction between the candidate interaction partners and Fas, the library plasmids were reintroduced into a second strain harboring a LexAFas fusion gene (LexA-lpr"g) in which the Fas portion had been mutated by substitution of Asn for Val at position 254 of the Fas precursor sequence. This mutation was expected to exhibit a molecular phenotype similar to that of the murine /ppg allele, which is formed by substitution of Asn for Ile at the homologous position. None of the candidate plasmids showing evidence of strong interaction with LexA-Fas were capable of interacting with LexAIprcg (Figure 1A; data not shown). Restriction site and sequence analysis of the cDNA inserts of the candidate clones showed that they fell into only two classes, each of which consisted of an incomplete cDNA. One of the inserts encoded the C-terminal residues 222-335 of the intracellular domain of Fas itself, and the other encoded a protein, subsequently named RIP, without overt relationship to previously described polypeptides. For simplicity in the following discussion, we will refer to the transcriptional activator fusion proteins expressed by the two classes of library isolates as Act-Fas and Act-RIP. The specificity of the interaction partners was further tested by using the library plasmids to transform yeast harboring expression plasmids encoding LexA fusions with intracellular domains of various cell surface receptors (Figure 1A). Although no interaction was detected in most cases (data not shown), weak promoter activity was discerned following introduction of the yeast plasmid encoding Act-RIP into strains harboring LexA-TNFRl intracellular domain. By contrast, no activity was seen when ActRIP was introduced into strains harboring LexA-TNFR2 intracellular domain. Yeast transformed with Act-Fas displayed promoter activity in strains harboring LexA-Fas intracellular domain, but showed no activity in strains harboring any other LexA-intracellular domain (Figure 1A). To measure this effect more precisely, p-gal assays were performed on lysates of yeast harboring various pairs of LexA-intracellular domain and Act-RIP. Lysates from yeast bearing LexA-Fas and Act-RIP contained about 30to 40-fold more P-gal activity than strains bearing Act-RIP and either LexA-lpr'gor LexA-TNFR2(Figure 1 B). Lysates prepared from yeast harboring LexA-TNFRl and Act-RIP expressed S-gal activity at about 10% of the level seen in lysates prepared from yeast bearing LexA-Fas and ActRIP (Figure 1 B). One explanation for the failure to detect an interaction between Act-RIP and LexA-lprcg or LexA-TNFR2 could have been that the LexA fusion proteins were poorly ex RIP:  A Novel 515  Cell Death  Protein  A Tlb I?.  III1  we prepared a set of LexA-Fas C-terminal deletion chimeras and tested their ability to support interaction with either Act-Fas or Act-RIP, as measured by P-gal colony assay (Figure 1C). These studies showed that the 16 C-terminal residues of Fas are not required for interaction with either RIP or Fas itself, but that removal of additional residues severely compromises the association with RIP. Cloning and Structure of Murine RIP Because the RIP cDNA insert identified by genetic selection in yeast did not encode an open reading frame bearing a consensus translational initiation sequence, additional human cDNA libraries were screened by hybridization for a full-length clone. None were identified, however, and several of the resulting isolates appeared to terminate at approximately the same 5'terminus, suggesting that secondary structure in the mRNA might have prevented extension of the cDNA by reverse transcriptase. Although the largest clone spanned approximately 1 kb of sequence, preliminary RNA blot hybridizations revealed a transcript of approximately 4.2 kb expressed in cell lines of diverse provenance, including tumors of lymphoid, hepatic, renal, neuronal, cervical, intestinal, muscular, and skeletal origin. To isolate a full-length clone, the human RIP coding sequence was used to probe a mouse thymus cDNA library. Four distinct overlapping clones were identified, ranging in size from 1 kb to 2.4 kb, as shown in Figure 2A. Restriction analysis and sequencing revealed that one of these clones, 1112,extended further 5' than the others. The 2.3 kb insert of III2 contains a 1968 nt open reading frame beginning with a translational initiation consensus sequence (Kozak, 1987) and predicting a polypeptide of 656 amino acids with a M, of 74,000 (Figure 28). The N-terminal region of RIP bears an extended homology to protein kinases that begins a few residues after the presumptive initiating Met and extends to the vicinity of residue 300. Quantitative sequence comparisons based on a word match algorithm (Altschul et al., 1990) predict that this domain is most similar overall to the Tyr subclass of protein kinases, with the highest relatedness seen to the mouse lckgene product (Marth et al., 1985). However, in the key subdomains that discriminate most closely between Tyr and Ser/Thr substrate specificity, the DLKPEN sequence (corresponding to kinase subdomain VI) and the GTLYYMAPE sequence (kinase subdomain VIII), RIP appears to match the Ser/Thr family consensus (Figure 3A; Hanks and Lindberg, 1991; Taylor and RadzioAndzelm, 1994). Residues that are conserved in kinases of both subclasses (for example, kinase subdomain IX; Figure 3A) are also well conserved in RIP. The sequence predicted by the longest of the human cDNA fragments consists of 375 amino acids corresponding to the region just C-terminal to the kinase domain of murine RIP and shares 67% sequence identity with the murine sequence over this length. Within this domain, the first 270 amino acids following the kinase domain have no striking homology to other proteins, although a small subdomain is highly conserved between mouse and human proteins (residues 391-427 of the murine sequence) and has a relatively high representation of Arg (R), Gln  Figure  2.

To address this possibility, a portion of each lysate used to measure enzyme activity was subjected to gel electrophoresis and blot transfer, followed by detection with anti-LexA antiserum. LexA fusion proteins of the appropriate size were detected in each of the lysates, and both the LexA-lpr"g and LexA-TNFR2 fusion proteins were found to be more abundantly expressed than LexA-Fas or LexA-TNFRl (data not shown), making it unlikely that failure to detect interaction in vivo could be attributed to degradation or inadequate synthesis of the LexA chimeras.

Comparable domains of approximately 90 residues close to the C-termini of Fas and TNFRl have been shown to play a role in the transduction of apoptotic signals to receptive cells and have been termed death domains for this reason (Tartagliaet al., 1993a). Pairwisecomparisonsof thedeath domain sequences aligned in Figure 38 showed the highest relatedness between human RIP and human TNFRl (59% similarity and 30% identity), which are significantly more similar than human Fas and human TNFRl (42% similarity and 23Yo identity). The interspecies conservation of the RIP death domain (84% identity between mouse and human) exceeds that of the TNFRl (68% identity) and Fas (49% identity) death domains. Constitutive and Inducible Expression of RIP mRNA Preliminary RNA blot hybridization experiments demonstrated the existence of an RNA species of approximately 3.8 kb in a variety of cell lines. To more precisely assess mRNA abundance in tissues, a quantitative ribonuclease protection assay was employed. Use of a labeled antisense RNA probe corresponding to the 3'terminus of the cDNA gave rise to a ribonuclease-resistant species of the expected size in all adult tissues tested (Figure 4A). An in vitro labeled RNA antisense to the mRNA for the ribosomal large subunit protein L32 was used as an internal standard to allow normalization to the amount of RNA loaded in each lane. Analysis of the protected RNA showed that RIP  mRNA levels varied by less than 2-to 3-fold between most tissues (data not shown); lung showed the highest expression, whereas tongue showed the least. The possibility that RIP mRNA might be regulated as a consequence of activation in T cells was also explored. Dissociated murine splenocytes were stimulated in vitro with the lectin-concanavalin A (ConA), and total RNA prepared at various times following addition of lectin was analyzed for the presence of RIP sequences by RNA blot analysis. Little or no RIP RNA could be detected in unstimulated splenocytes, but a single 3.8 kb species appeared in unfractionated splenocytes that had been exposed to lectin for 2 hr or longer (Figure 48). Since RIP mRNA is detectable by ribonuclease protection in the spleen as a whole (Figure 4A), the inability to detect RIP mRNA in splenocytes treated with ConAfor less than 2 hr is probably due to the lower sensitivity of RNA blot analysis, although this discrepancy could also have resulted from RIP expression exclusively in the fibrous tissue of the spleen. A Polypeptide of the Expected Molecular Mass Is Expressed In Vivo To examine the distribution of RIP protein in vivo, a rabbit antiserum was prepared against a fusion protein consisting of the 250 C-terminal residues of murine RIP fused to E. coli maltose-binding protein. The antiserum specificity was validated by immunoprecipitation of RIP synthesized in vitro. Following in vitro transcription and translation of the RIP open reading frame, a single labeled product of approximately 74 kDa was observed that could be specifically immunoprecipitated with the rabbit antiserum, but not with serum from unimmunized animals (Figures 5A and 58). The specificity of the antiserum for RIP was alsodocumented by its inability to immunoprecipitate an irrelevant protein (Photinus pyralis luciferase) similarly translated in vitro. lmmunoprecipitation of a lysate of metabolically labeled NIH 3T3 cells with the rabbit antiserum  RIP: A Novel 517  Cell Death  Protein  A Protected fragments Spleen Stomach Ovary Sm.

Detection of RIP in Transiently Transfected BHK Cells To determine whether RIP protein could have a direct effect on cell viability, BHK cells grown on coverslips were transiently transfected with an epitope-tagged version of RIP (RIP-Myc) and reacted with anti-RIP antiserum or an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. Weak expression was detected with both antibodies. The pattern of immunoreactivity was heterogeneous, with both diffuse cytoplasmic as well as punctate perinuclear patterns observed (Figures  6A and 6B). DNA staining with Hoechst 33256 showed that many of the RIP-expressing cells had apoptotic nuclei, a feature not seen when vector or Fas control expression plasmids were used (data not shown). However, a number of RIP-expressing cells could be found that had normalappearing nuclei; conversely, apoptotic cells having no detectable RIP staining were also seen. The concordance of cell death and RIP expression suggested the ability to detect RIP-Myc protein might be compromised by the death of the cells in which it was being expressed. To test this and the possible role of individual RIP domains in apoptosis, two additional epitope-tagged constructs were prepared: one lacking C-terminal sequences, including the death domain (RIP-MycAdeath),  I IrnI :  Cell 518  Figure  8. RIP lmmunofluorescence  BHK cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing RIP-Myc (A-C), RIPMycAkinase (D-F), or RIP-MycAdeath (G-H) and reacted with anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies (A, D, and G), anti-RIP polyclonal antibodies (Band E), or Hoechst 33258(C, F, and H). Cells transfected with RIP-MycAdeath plasmid did not react with anti-RIP antisera (data not shown).  and one lacking - 200 amino acids in the kinase domain (RIP-MycAkinase). Both deletion mutants showed greater immunoreactivity with anti-Myc antibodies (Figures 6D and 6G) than the full-length construct. Only RIPMycAkinase was detected by the anti-RIP antiserum (Figure 6E), as expected from the deletion of its epitope from  RIP-MycAdeath. RIP Overexpression Leads to Cell Death To determine whether RIP was inducing cell death, we marked the transfected cells by cotransfection with P-gal. Cells were transfected with pairs of expression plasmids encoding RIP-Myc and p-gal (Price et al., 1987) at a 1:3 ratio of P-gal plasmid to RIP plasmid. After histochemical detection of P-gal activity, cells transfected with S-gal and RIP-Myc expression plasmids were found to contain a large proportion of intensely staining, shrunken blue cells that exhibited membrane blebbing and loss of adherence (Figures 7A and 7E). By contrast, transfection with P-gal, either alone (Figure 7D) or in combination with RIPMycAdeath (Figure 7C), had no adverse effect upon nuclear morphology and resulted in a predominantly cytoplasmic P-gal staining pattern. Cotransfection of P-gal with RIP-MycAkinase likewise gave cytoplasmic staining of  healthy-appearing cells, although a number of shrunken, blebbed cells were also seen (Figure 7B). To quantitate these results, cells from three independent transfections were examined, and the morphologically apoptotic blue cells were enumerated as a fraction of total blue cells (Table 1). Over 57% of blue cells arising from cotransfection of RIP-Myc and the P-gal showed morphological changes consistent with apoptosis, whereas only l%-2% of blue cells that had been transfected with P-gal plasmid or in combination with RIP-MycAdeath exhibited such a phenotype. However, a consistent frequency of apoptotic changes was seen in cotransfections involving RIP-MycAkinase, with almost 11% of the blue cells appearing to have undergone cell death. The fraction of cells showing morphological changes was positively correlated with the ratio of RIP-Myc or RIP-MycAkinase plasmid to P-gal plasmid, so that increasing RIP$-gal plasmid ratios gave higher percentages of dead blue cells (data not shown). Additional transfection experiments were performed using cells derived from the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line (Pear et al., 1993). As with the previous assay, cell death was observed in these cells when either the RIP-Mycor RIP-MycAkinase plasmid was used. DNAfrag RIP:  A Novel 519  Cell Death  Protein  Table  1.

In this study, a genetic selection in yeast for proteins capable of interacting with the intracellular domain of Fasl APO-l identified cDNAs encoding two proteins from a human T cell cDNA library: Fas itself and a novel kinaserelated protein, RIP, containing a death domain. Neither protein interacts with a humanized variant of the murine /pr"g allele, a point mutant that confers much the same phenotype on affected mice as does the original Ipr allele (Matsuzawa et al., 1990). The finding that the intracellular domain of the /pP variant is incapable of interacting with the wild-type Fas cytoplasmic domain in yeast suggests that oligomerization of Fas mediated by cytoplasmic sequences may be a prerequisite for activity. However, it has not been established whether oligomerization of Fas is necessary for interaction with RIP, or whether the same subdomain exploited for oligomerization is also required for heteromeric association with RIP. The discovery of the Fas-Fas interaction in a library screen is consistent with a recent demonstration that TNFRl and Fas are capable of both self- and cross-association in yeast (Boldin et al.,  1995). In accord with the notion that the death domain may itself mediate such interactions, we find here that RIP can also associate with the intracellular domain of TNFRl. Despite conservation of sequence, structure, and function between Fas and TNFRl , downstream effects of the two receptors have been dissociated in some cell types (Wong and Goeddel, 1994; Schulze-Osthoff et al., 1994), whereas responses in other cells suggest that elements of their signaling pathways may be shared (Clement and Stamenkovic, 1994; Schulze-Osthoff et al., 1994). The finding that RIP interacts with both Fas and TNFRl in yeast is attractive for its intimation of a simple explanation for the shared manifestations of receptor ligation. Deletion analysis of Fas has previously demonstrated that the 15 C-terminal amino acids are not required for signaling, but that larger deletions abolish the ability of Fas to induce apoptosis (Itoh and Nagata, 1993). Consistent with these findings, this study has shown that in yeast RIP binds well to a Fas molecule lacking the 16 C-terminal amino acids, but that larger deletions of the Fas cytoplasmic domain greatly reduce or abolish this interaction. The human RIP fragment identified by yeast interaction was used to clone a murine cDNA that appears to span the entire coding region. The authentic 5' and 3' ends of the RIP mRNA have yet to be defined, however. Sequencing of the 3'ends of cDNA clones 1111,1112,and I1 b yielded about 1.4 kb of putative untranslated sequence including an AAUAAA transcription termination signal, but no poly(A) tail (data not shown). Genomic sequence obtained from the S'end suggests the presence of at least one more noncoding 5' exon (data not shown). Of the discrepancy between the 3.4 kb of identified sequence and the approximately 3.6 kb of RNA identified in blot hybridization experiments, the fraction that can be attributed to poly(A) is uncertain. RIP mRNA is expressed at low levels in all tissues. A pattern of widespread expression has also been observed for Fas (Leithauser et al., 1993; B. Z. S. and P. L., unpublished data), although in contrast with RIP, fas mRNA is found at higher levels in thymus, liver, lung, and heart. Like fas mRNA, RIP mRNA is induced in splenocytes after activation with ConA. Although a requirement for RIP in Fas-mediated killing has not been established, coordinate induction of Fas and RIP may contribute to increased sus Cdl  520  ceptibility of T cells to Fas-mediated cell death following activation (Owen-Schaub et al., 1992). The N-terminus of RIP has strong homology to kinases of both SerIlhr and Tyr kinase subfamilies. In the two interacting loops that appear to control hydroxyamino acid recognition (Hubbard et al., 1994; Taylor and RadzioAndzelm, 1994), RIP closely resembles a Ser/Thr kinase. In particular, it lacks the Ala-X-Arg or Arg-X-Ala motif in subdomain VI and the Pro-X-X-Trp motif in subdomain VIII that closely correlate with Tyr substrate specificity (Hanks et al., 1986). However, among sequences available at the time of submission, RIP shows the greatest global similarity to murine Ick, a Tyr kinase of the Src family. The relatedness to Tyr kinases is especially apparent among the framework residues outside the putative active site. For example, RIP has a tryptophan at position 269 that is present in all Tyr kinases analyzed by Hanks and Quinn (1991), but absent from all Ser/Thr kinases examined except Mos. The presence of structural motifs from both Tyr and Ser/lhr kinases has also been noted for the soybean kinase GmPK6 (Feng et al., 1993), with which RIP shares high global similarity. RIP contains a small number of amino acids that differ from the conserved residues of either Ser/Thr or Tyr kinases, for example a Gly at position 24 that is present in the majority of kinases from both classes. However, at residues that are conserved in all protein kinases, RIP follows the consensus. We have found that overexpression of RIP results in the induction of a cell death program morphologically similar to apoptosis. Deletion of the C-terminal region of RIP spanning the segment of death domain homology eliminated the apoptotic response, but deletion of the kinase domain did not entirely quench activity. It may be that the overexpression of the death domain itself is lethal to transfected cells, consistent with the observation by Boldin et al. (1995) that expression of the free intracellular domain of TNFRl has a cytocidal effect on HeLa cells. The induction of apoptosis by transient transfection suggests that the level of expression or ability of death domain-bearing proteins to self-associate may be subject to some form of regulation to prevent the spontaneous initiation of apoptosis in the absence of ligand or other eliciting stimulus. The notion that a stoichiometrically limiting intracellular effector is involved in the pathway of Fas-mediated apoptosis is supported by the recent demonstration that maximal signaling by Fas and the TNF receptors requires an intermediate level of receptor cell surface expression (Clement and Stamenkovic, 1994). This result is consistent with a model in which the initiation of signal transduction is critically dependent on the aggregation-mediated focal accumulation of a limiting cytoplasmic ligand, which can be diluted to the point of inefficacy by overexpression of the cell surface receptor. The data presented here that RIP is not encoded by a highly expressed RNA, but that the transcript accumulates rapidly in response to T cell activation, in turn admits the possibility that RIP may be limiting for receptor-mediated apoptosis. However, other factors may also interact with the Fas intracellu!ar domain, as suggested by the findings that Fas can transmit activation as well as death signals (Alderson et al., 1993).  Still unclear is the mechanism by which formation of a multimeric Fas complex would result in signal transduction. Although enzymatic activity has not been demonstrated for RIP, the possibility that it encodes a protein kinase is attractive given the proposed participation of at least one Tyr kinase in Fas signaling (Eischen et al., 1994). However, results with the mutant plasmid RIPMycAkinase suggest thar any kinase potential RIP has may not be required for its induction of cell death. In preliminary experiments, a monoclonal antibody recognizing murine Fas has been found to specifically coimmunoprecipitate a polypeptide of about 59 kDa that reacts with anti-RIP antiserum (data not shown). This 59 kDa protein may represent a proteolytic fragment of RIP or a related protein that is recognized by anti-RIP antibodies. Although the evidence that RIP binds to Fas in yeast favors a model in which RIP acts directly downstream of Fas in a death pathway, it is also possible that RIP has other actions, or that the normal physiological role of the molecule lies in a pathway initiated by other cues. The creation of mice or cell lines homozygously deficient in RIP should help to address this point. In addition, the elucidation of any target(s) of action of RIP may also facilitate our understanding of the role(s) RIP plays in the cell death response. Experimental Procedures  Plasmid Construction The yeast interaction system was modified from that described by Gyuris et al. (1993) by engineering the LexA expression plasmid to remove an internal Mlul site and to insert Mlul and Not1 sites downstream from the DNA portion encoding the C-terminus of the gene. The resulting distal polylinker has the site sequence Mlul-Pmel-NotlEcoRl in the frame in which the Mlul site encodes Thr and Arg (frame 1). Complete sequences are available from the authors (B. S.) upon request. Receptor cytoplasmic tails were amplified by PCR from cDNA libraries and cloned as Mlul-Not1 or BssHII-Not1 fragments using the following oligos: Fas, 5'-CGC GGG ACG CGT AAG GAA GTA CAG AAA ACA TGCJ' and 5'-CGC GGG GCG GCC GCT CTA GAC CAA GCT TTG GAT I-X-3'; TNFRl, 5' CGC GGG GCG CGC TAC CAA CGG TGG AAG TCC AAG-3' and 5' CGC GGG GCG GCC GCT GCC CGC AGG GGC GCA GCC TCA-3'; TNFRZ, 5'-CGC GGG ACG CGT AAG AAG CCC lTG TGC CTG CAG-3' and 5'-CGC GGG GCG GCC GCT lTA ACT GGG Cl7 CAT CCC AGC-3'. The Fas cytoplasmic domain used in the library screen diverges at the Glu 5 residues prior to the C-terminus and continues an additional 25 residues through vector sequences to the C-terminus. In all subsequent analysis, these residues were found not to contribute detectably to either Fas-Fas or FasRIP interaction. A mutant Fas bait protein analogous to the /pp point mutation was made by mutating the Val at position 254 of human Fas to Asn using the following oligos in a recombinant PCR reaction: 5'-CGA AAG AAT GGT AAC AAT GAA GCC-3' and 5'-GGC TTC Al7 GlT ACC Al7 CTT TCGJ'. In the resulting construct, residues 330 and 331 were also converted from Glu and Ile to Gly and Asn, respectively. Fas deletion mutants were made by PCR with the Fas 5' oligo and 3'oligos substituting a stop codon for the amino acid at the indicated position; products were subcloned in!o the LexA expression plasmid as described above. Oligos used were the following: (S320') 5'~CGC GGG GCG GCC GCT TTA AGT AAT GTC CTT GAG GAT GAT-3'; (K299') ?I'-CGC GGG GCG GCC GCT TTA GAG ATC l-l-T AAT CAA TGT GTC-3'; (H265') 5'-CGC GGG GCG GCC GCT TTA AAG TTG ATG CCA ATT ACG AAG-3'; (K263') 5'CGC GGG GCG GCC GCT TTA GAT CTC ATC TAT l-IT GGC -lTC-3'. A Myc-tagged version of RIP (RIP-Myc) was made by digesting RIP clone III2 with Tfil and ligating a Hindlll-Tfil adaptor to the B'end and a Tfil-Notl adaptor containing the Myc epitope and a stop codon to the 3'end. The sense (145) and antisense (146) oligonucleotides com RIP:  A Novel 521  Cell Death  Protein  prising the 3' adaptor were as follows: 145, 5'-ATT CGT GCC AGC CAG AGC GGC ATG GAG CAG AAG CTC ATC TCA GAA GAA GAC CTC GCG TAA GC-3' and 146, 5'-GGC CGC TTA CGC GAG GTC TTC l-K TGA GAT GAG CT-T CTG CTC CAT GCC GCT CTG GCT GGC ACG-3'. The resulting insert was cloned into the Hindlll and Notl sites of pcDNA I (Invitrogen). To make RIP-MycAkinase, a PCR reaction was performed using a 5' RIP primer (160, 5'CCC AAG CTT GTT GGA GAT TCT GAG CAA TC-3') and an internal kinase domain primer (161, B'CCC GAT CTG CAG GTC ATG TAA GTA GCA CAT GCC-3'). The resulting product was cloned into the Hindlll and Pstl sites of RIP-Myc resulting in the deletion of RIP residues 132-323. RIP-MycAdeath was made by PCR using a T7 primer and a Myc tagcontaining primer (151, 5'CCC CTC GAG TTA GAG GTC TTC TTC TGA GAT GAG CTT TTG CTC TlT ClT TAA ACT TGC CAC-3'). The amplified RIP-MycAdeath sequence, lacking amino acids 309-656, was subcloned as a Hindlll-Xhol fragment into pcDNA I. Myc tags were located at the C-terminus of all proteins, and thus, detection of the Myc epitope requires translation of the entire cloned sequence. The BAG retrovirus vector encoding p-gal has been described (Price et al., 1967). Yeast Strains and Library Screen Yeast transformation with library DNA was performed by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (1989) as follows,Recipient cells, EGY48/pRBl840 (Gyuris et al., 1993) bearing LexA-fusion protein plasmids, were grown overnight in YPAD medium to a density of approximately lO'cells/ml, then diluted in 100 ml of warmed YPAD to a density of 2 x 108 cells/ ml and regrown to IO' cells/ml. The cells were harvested and washed in water, resuspended in 1 ml of water, transferred to a sterile microcentrifuge tube, and pelleted. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of IO mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5) 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M Li acetate (pH adjusted to 7.5 with acetic acid and passed through 0.2 u filter). 50 ul of the resulting suspension was mixed with 1 pg of transforming DNA and 50 ug of single-stranded salmon sperm DNA, after which 0.3 ml of a solution of 40% polyethylene glycol-4000 in Tris, EDTA, LiOAc was added and mixed thoroughly, followed by incubation at 30°C with agitation for 30 min. After a heat pulse at 42OC for 15 min, the cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge, and the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Tris, EDTA, diluted, and plated on selective medium. Library screening and recovery of plasmids were performed as described by Gyuris et al. (1993). For assessing the interaction of RIP and Fas with other bait proteins, cells of the yeast strain EGY48/pSHl6-34 were transformed with the indicated bait construct and selected on Ura- His- glucose plates, These bait strains were subsequently used for transformation of the RIP or Fas library plasmids and plated on Ura- His- Trp- glucose plates. Several colonies from each baitlinteractor combination were picked and plated in duplicate on Ura- His- Trp- X-Gal plates containing either 2% glucose or 2% galactose, 1% raffinose. The LexATNFRP bait strain gave a weak blue color reaction when grown on galactose, indicating spontaneous transcriptional activation by the fusion protein. B-Gal Assays Assays of crude extracts were carried out as described (Rose et al., 1990). Cells bearing the appropriate bait and interaction plasmid were grown to saturation overnight at 30°C in minimal Ura- His- Trp- medium with 2% glucose. The next day, cells were diluted I:50 into medium containing 2% galactose and 2% raffinose and allowed to grow overnight. Cells were spun and resuspended in breaking buffer (100 mM Tris [pH 61, 20% glycerol [v/v], 1 mM DTT). Cells were lysed in the presence of 10 mM PMSF by vortexing with acid-washed beads. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and an aliquot was incubated in 2 buffer (Miller, 1972) with 0.67 mglml o-nitrophenyl+D-galactoside substrate. Reactions were stopped with Na2C03 when an appropriate level of color had developed. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. B-Gal units were calculated by the equation: specific activity (nmoleslminlmg) = (OD1,. 378)/(time [min].vol [ml].concentration [mglml]). cDNA Cloning Additional clones overlapping two libraries: an expression  vector using mRNA isolated from the human cytolytic T cell line WH3 and a commercially available human leukocyte library in A. phage purchased from Clontech (HLl ISSa). Both libraries were screened by filter replica hybridization, using radiolabeled probes derived from the insert isolated by interaction screening, as well as from subsequent inserts identified by hybridization. To isolate murine RIP cDNA clones, 1.2 kb of human RIP sequence was subcloned into two halves and radiolabeled using the random hexamer method (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983). An oligo(dT)primed mouse thymus cDNA library from a (C57B1/6 x CBA)Fl mouse (Stratagene) was plated out and I@ plaques werescreened using each of the human fragments on duplicate GeneScreen filters (DuPont). Hybridization conditions were 5 x SSPE, 10x Denhardts. 2% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA at 55'C overnight. Filters were washed in 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55OC with several changes over 1 hr. Plaque purified phage were isolated with three roundsof screening (Sambrook et al., 1989) and in vivo excision was carried out using Exassist phage and SOLR recipient cells (Stratagene). Seven independent clones were isolated that fell into the four classes in Figure 2A. The coding sequence of RIP was obtained as a composite from the cDNA clones sequenced on both strands using Sequenase T7 polymerase (United States Biochemical). Several nucleotide polymorphisms were da tected between the multiple clones, only one of which resulted in an amino acid difference: a Thr to Ile at position 473. Sequence comparisons were done with Genetics Computer Group, Inc. or MegAlign (DNAStar, Inc.) software using default parameters. RNase Protections and RNA Blot Hybrldlzation Tissue RNA samples were prepared from wild-type FVB mice (Taconic) by guanidinium thiocyanate lysis and centrifugation through a CsCl cushion (Chirgwin et al., 1979). An antisense probe for RIP made from cDNA clone Ill1 linearized with Spel was synthesized using T7 polymerase with an in vitro transcription kit (Stratagene), with the addition of 20 nM cold rUTP and 100 pCi (SP]UTP (New England Nuclear). The ribosomal L32 probe was synthesized from an Xbal-linearized template at 10% the specific activity of the RIP probe. The use of L32 as an internal control for RNA loading has been described elsewhere (Shen and Leder, 1992). The in vitro transcription products were slightly larger than the protected fragments of 525 nt and 279 nt, respectively, as expected. RNase protection was carried out as described by Melton et al. (1984). For measuring RIP in activated T cells, spleens were removed from adult animals and dissociated using a stainless steel mesh. Cells (-10' per timepoint) were exposed to ConA (IO uglml) for O-4.5 hr, and RNA was prepared as described above. Approximately 8 ug of total RNA from each sample was loaded on a 0.9% agarose, 4% formaldehyde gel, electrophoresed, and transferred to nylon filters (GeneScreen, DuPont) by capillary transfer (Sambrook et al., 1989). The blot was hybridized with either an RIP probe corresponding to the C-terminal half of the protein (cDNA 1111)or with a probe detecting ribosomal 28s RNA and incubated overnight in 40% formamide, 4x SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 7 mM Tris (pH 7.6) and 20 uglml salmon sperm DNA at 42°C. Blots were washed at 50°C in 1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS (RIP probe) or 60°C in 0.1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS (28s probe). RIP Antisera and lmmunopreclpitations Rabbit polyclonal antisera recognizing RIP were prepared by Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory, Inc. using a fusion protein containing the C-terminal 250 amino acids of mouse RIP fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP; New England Biolabs). MEP-RIP was purified by amy lose chromatography and acrylamide gel elution. For immunoprecipitations, RIP was first transcribed in vitro using 15 ug of full-length RIP template in a reaction containing 3.3 mM each ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP, 280 U of RNase inhibitor, 400 U of Sp6 RNA polymerase, and 1 x Sp6 buffer (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals). Translations were carried out using a reticulocyte lysate kit containing a luciferase positive control (Promega) using approximately4 uCi ["S]Met per reaction. Reaction products were diluted to 1 ml in a modified RIPA buffer (0.5% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.025% SDS, 50 mM Tris, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 100 uM sodium orthovanadate [pH 7.61) containing protease inhibitors and precleared with normal rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose. Reactions were split in half, 5 nl of preimmune or immune serum was added, and samples  the primary RIP isolate were sought in library prepared in the CDM8 plasmid  Cell 522  were allowed to rotate for 1 hr at 4%. Complexes were precipitated with 40 ~1 of protein A-Sepharose (1:l). washed with modified RIPA buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation from metabolically labeled cells, a 150 mm plate of subconfluent NIH 3T3 cells was incubated overnight in Metdeficient DMEM (GIBCOIBRL) supplemented with [".S]Met (- 100 pCi/ ml), 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, penicillin (50 UI ml), and streptomycin (50 pglml). Cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in lysis buffer (250 mM NaCI, 50 mM HEPES-KOH, [pH 7.51, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, 0.1% Triton-X, 100 Kg/ml PMSF, 2 pglml pepstatin, and IO pglml each aprotonin and leupeptin), scraped, and spun at 15,000 x g for 10 min. Cleared lysate was precleared as above, followed by addition of antibodies (3 ul of preimmune or immune rabbit serum). Immune complexes were harvested with protein A-Sepharose, and beads were washed with lysis buffer before resuspension in denaturing sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, thegel wasenhanced with enlightening solution (DuPont) and dried for autoradiography. Transfections and lmmunofluorescence BHK cells were plated the night before transfection at a density of lo4 cells per 18 mm round coverslip (VWR Scientific). CaP04 precipitates were made, and cells were reacted with antibodies for immunofluorescence as described by Heald et al. (1993). In most cases, cells were analyzed 18-20 hr after transfection. The 9ElO anti-Myc antibody (Evan et al., 1985) was obtained as an ascites from the Harvard Cell Culture facility and used at 20 pglml. RIP antiserum was used at a dilution of 1:200. FITC anti-mouse and Texas red anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch. Cells were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope. p-Gal activity in cells was visualized by fixing cells with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min followed by extensive washing in PBS with 5 mM MgCI,. Cells were stained in PBS containing 20 mM each kFe(CN)B and K4Fe(CN),.3H20, 1 mM MgC12, and 1 mglml X-Gal (5.bromo-4chloro-Mndolyl-g-D-galactopyranoside) until a suitable color developed, usually for 2-3 hr. To enumerate the fraction of blue cells that had undergone apoptotic changes, cells were transfected with one of the four plasmid combinations described and fixed 16 hr after transfection. Blue cells were included for analysis only if their morphological status could be scored unambiguously.

																													<Abstract>Complexed with its intracellular receptor, FKBP12, the natural product rapamycin inhibits G1 progression of the cell cycle in a variety of mammalian cell lines and in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae. Previously, a mammalian protein that directly associates with FKBP12-rapamycin has been identified and its encoding gene has been cloned from both human (designated FRAP) [Brown, E.J., Albers, M.W., Shin, T.B., Ichikawa, K., Keith, C.T., Lane, W.S. &amp; Schreiber, S.L. (1994) Nature (London) 369, 756-758] and rat (designated RAFT) [Sabatini, D.M., Erdjument-Bromage, H., Lui, M., Tempst, P. &amp; Snyder, S.H. (1994) Cell 78, 35-43]. The full-length FRAP is a 289-kDa protein containing a putative phosphatidylinositol kinase domain. Using an in vitro transcription/translation assay method coupled with proteolysis studies, we have identified an 11-kDa FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain within FRAP. This minimal binding domain lies N-terminal to the kinase domain and spans residues 2025-2114. In addition, we have carried out mutagenesis studies to investigate the role of Ser2035, a potential phosphorylation site for protein kinase C within this domain. We now show that the FRAP Ser2035--&gt;Ala mutant displays similar binding affinity when compared with the wild-type protein, whereas all other mutations at this site, including mimics of phosphoserine, abolish binding, presumably due to either unfavorable steric interactions or induced conformational changes.</Abstract>

																													<Abstract>By rational mutagenesis, receptor-specific functional analysis, and visualization of complex formation in solution, we identified individual amino acid side chains involved specifically in the interaction of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) with CNTFR alpha and not with the beta-components, gp130 and LIFR. In the crystal structure, the side chains of these residues, which are located in helix A, the AB loop, helix B, and helix D, are surface accessible and are clustered in space, thus constituting an epitope for CNTFR alpha. By the same analysis, a partial epitope for gp130 was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha-epitope. Superposition of the CNTF and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on CNTF is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone. Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha- and beta-receptors on interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines. In each case, epitope I is utilized by the specificity-conferring component, whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components. Thus, in addition to a common fold, helical cytokines share a conserved order of receptor epitopes that is function related.</Abstract>

Components of a signaling pathway that couples the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor to induction of transcription were identified. CNTF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of p91, a protein implicated in interferon signaling pathways, and of two proteins that are distinct but related to p91. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p91 translocated to the nucleus, where p91 and p91-related proteins bound to a DNA sequence found in promoters of genes responsive to CNTF. This DNA sequence, when inserted upstream of a reporter gene, conferred a transcriptional response to CNTF. A pathway that transduces interferon signals may therefore have a more general function in the propagation of responses to certain neurotrophic factors.

																														<Abstract>Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase positioned downstream of Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Using a yeast two-hybrid strategy to identify other proteins that interact with and potentially regulate Raf-1, we isolated a clone encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of the G beta 2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. In vitro, purified G beta gamma subunits specifically bound to a GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1-330 of Raf-1 (Raf/330). Binding assays with truncation mutants of GST-Raf indicate that the region located between amino acids 136 and 239 is a primary determinant for interaction with G beta gamma. In competition experiments, the carboxyl terminus of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) blocked the binding of G beta gamma to Raf/330; however, the Raf-1-binding proteins, Ras and 14-3-3, had no effect. Scatchard analysis of in vitro binding between Raf/330 and G beta gamma revealed an affinity of interaction (Kd = 163 +/- 36 nM), similar to that seen between G beta gamma and beta ARK (Kd = 87 +/- 24 nM). The formation of native heterotrimeric G alpha beta gamma complexes, as measured by pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation of G alpha, could be disrupted by increasing amounts of Raf/330, with an EC50 of approximately 200 nM, in close agreement with the estimated binding affinity. In vivo complexes of Raf-1 and G beta gamma were isolated from human embryonic kidney 293-T cells transfected with epitope-tagged G beta 2. The identification and characterization of this novel interaction raises several possibilities for signaling cross-talk between growth factor receptors and those receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins.</Abstract>

																													Identification of the major phosphorylation sites of the Raf-1 kinase. â&#x20AC;&#x201D; JBC Skip to main page content Home Current issue Archive Papers in Press Minireviews Classics Reflections Papers of the Week QUICK SEARCH Author: Keyword: Year: Vol: Page: GO [Advanced Search] [Browse the Archive] Institution: BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM AUSTR Sign In Advertisement Advertisement Identification of the major phosphorylation sites of the Raf-1 kinase. D K Morrison , G Heidecker , U R Rapp and T D Copeland ABL-Basic Research Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702. Abstract Treatment of cells with various growth factors and mitogens results in the rapid hyperphosphorylation and activation of the Raf-1 kinase. To determine if phosphorylation events affect Raf-1 activity, we have initiated experiments to identify the phosphorylation sites of Raf-1. In this report, we find that Ser43, Ser259, and Ser621 are the major sites of Raf-1 which are phosphorylated in mammalian cells and in Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus encoding human Raf-1. Mutant Raf-1 proteins lacking kinase activity are also phosphorylated on these sites in vivo, indicating that these phosphorylation events are not a consequence of autophosphorylation. Furthermore, we find that Thr268 is the predominant Raf-1 residue phosphorylated in in vitro autokinase assays. In addition, we have examined the biochemical activity of baculovirus-expressed Raf-1 proteins containing mutations at these phosphorylation sites. In in vitro protein kinase assays Ser259 mutant proteins were 2-fold more active than wild-type Raf-1 and Ser621 mutant proteins were inactive as kinases. Analysis of the residues surrounding Ser259 and Ser621 indicates that RSXSXP may be a consensus sequence for the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Raf-1 at these sites. Interestingly, these RSXSXP sequences are completely conserved throughout evolution in all Raf family members. CiteULike Complore Connotea Del.icio.us Digg What's this?

																														<Abstract>Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.</Abstract>

																														<Abstract>Eosinophils undergo chemotaxis, degranulate, and exhibit [C2+]i changes in response to the human CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), but the receptors involved have not been defined. We have isolated a human cDNA encoding the first eosinophil-selective chemokine receptor, designated CC chemokine receptor 3 (CC CKR3). CC CKR3 is a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor most closely related to the previously reported monocyte- and neutrophil-selective receptor CC CKR1 (also known as the MIP-1 alpha/RANTES receptor). When [Ca2+]i changes were monitored in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, MIP-1 alpha and RANTES were both potent agonists for CC CKR3 and CC CKR1. However, MIP-1 beta was also an agonist for CC CKR3 but not CC CKR1; MCP-3 was an agonist for CC CKR1 but not CC CKR3. CC CKR3 may be one of the host factors responsible for selective recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation.</Abstract>

																														<Abstract>The extracellular segment of the receptor-type type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu, possesses an MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats. It binds homophilically, i.e., PTPmu on the surface of one cell binds to PTPmu on an apposing cell, and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain. The intracellular segment of PTPmu has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. In cadherins, this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we demonstrate that PTPmu associates with a complex containing cadherins, alpha- and beta-catenin in mink lung (MvLu) cells, and in rat heart, lung, and brain tissues. Greater than 80% of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X-100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PTPmu; however, the complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent, SDS-containing RIPA buffer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of PTPmu binds directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, but not to alpha- or beta-catenin. Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo, PTPmu, cadherins, and catenins all localized to points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical staining. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including PTPmu, the cadherins associated with PTPmu are now found in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for PTPmu.

<BodyText>Published August 1, 1995  Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase PTPlx Associates with Cadherins and Catenins In Vivo Susann M. Brady-Kalnay,* David L. Rimm,* and Nicholas K. Tonks* *Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724-2208; and *Department of Pathology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06510-8023  Abstract. The extracellular segment of the receptortype protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPIx, possesses an MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain, and four fibronectin type-III repeats. It binds homophilically, i.e., PTPIx on the surface of one cell binds to PTPtx on an apposing cell, and the binding site lies within the immunoglobulin domain. The intracellular segment of PTPIx has two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins. In cadherins, this segment interacts with proteins termed catenins to mediate association with the actin cytoskeleton. In this article, we demonstrate that PTPIx associates with a complex containing cadherins, a- and f3-catenin in mink lung (MvLu) cells, and in rat heart, lung, and brain tissues. Greater than 80% of the cadherin in the cell is cleared from Triton X-100 lysates of MvLu cells after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PTPIx; however, the  complex is dissociated when lysates are prepared in more stringent, SDS-containing RIPA buffer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that the intracellular segment of PTP~ binds directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, but not to or- or [3-catenin. Consistent with their ability to interact in vivo, PTP~, cadherins, and catenins all localized to points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical staining. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity including PTPIx, the cadherins associated with PTPp~ are now found in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate for PTP~. These data suggest that PTP~ may be one of the enzymes that regulates the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus function, of the cadherin/catenin complex in vivo.  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  ANY cellular processes are regulated by reversible tyrosine phosphorylation, controlled by the balanced and opposing actions of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1 and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). PTPs exist in both soluble and transmembrane, receptor-like forms (Charbonneau and Tonks, 1992; Tonks, 1993). In the case of the receptor PTPs (RPTPs), there is the potential for regulating activity by the binding of ligands to the extracellular segment of the protein. Several of the transmembrane PTPs are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and display structural motifs in their extracellular segments that are suggestive of a role in cellcell adhesion (for review see Brady-Kalnay and Tonks, 1994a). To date, two RPTPs, PTPtx and PTPK, have been shown to mediate aggregation via homophilic binding (Brady-Kalnay et al., 1993; Gebbink et al., 1993; Sap et al.,  M  Address all correspondence to N. K.

GST, glutathione-S-transferase; IP, immunoprecipitation; PTK, protein tyrosine kinase; PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase.  1994). Thus, the ligand for these two RPTPs is an identical molecule on an apposing cell, suggesting that they may transduce signals in response to cell contact. Information concerning ligands for other RPTPs is also beginning to emerge. PTPUI3 is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (Barnea et al., 1994; Maeda et al., 1994; Shitara et al., 1994). Phosphacan, a splice variant comprising the PTPg/[~ extracellular segment, has been shown to interact heterophilically with N-CAM, Ng-CAM, and tenascin (Grumet et al., 1994; Maurel et al., 1994; Milev et al., 1994). Our studies have focused on PTP~z. We have shown previously that PTP~ can mediate aggregation of cells via homophilic binding (Brady-Kalnay et al., 1993), and that the homophilic binding site resides in the Ig domain (BradyKalnay and Tonks, 1994b). The intracellular segment of PTPp~ is characterized by two PTP domains and a juxtamembrane segment that is ~-,70 residues longer than the equivalent segment in most other RPTPs, and displays homology to the entire intracellular domain of members of the cadherin family (for review see Brady-Kalnay and Tonks, 1994a). Cadherins are a major family of calciumdependent cell-cell adhesion molecules that also bind by a homophilic mechanism and localize to specialized intercel ©  The RockefellerUniversityPress, 0021-95251951081977110 $2.00 The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 130, Number 4, August 1995 977-986  977  Published August 1, 1995  lular junctions called adherens junctions (for reviews see Grunwald, 1993; Nagafuchi et al., 1993). The cadherins are transmembrane proteins possessing an extracellular calcium-binding segment and an intracellular domain that is highly conserved (,--~90% identity) among most members of the family. Deletions of the conserved intracellular segment can prevent adhesion even when the extracellular binding domain is intact (Nagafuchi and Takeichi, 1988). The cytoplasmic domain of the cadherins interacts with three molecules termed catenins (ct, [3, ~/), and the complex associates with cortical actin (Rimm et al., 1995b; for reviews see Ranscht, 1994; Cowin, 1994). Two of the catenins have been cloned, a-catenin is homologous to vinculin, a cytoskeletal-associated protein. 13-catenin is homologous to plakoglobin, a protein found at desmosomes, and armadillo, a segment polarity gene in Drosophila melanogaster (Herrenknecht et al., 1991; McCrea et al., 1991; Nagafuchi et al., 1991). Immunochemical data suggest that ~/-catenin is identical to plakoglobin (Knudsen and Wheelock, 1992; Pipenhagen and Nelson, 1993). It appears that [3-catenin and plakoglobin bind directly to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin while ct-catenin binds directly to [3-catenin and plakoglobin (Aberle et al., 1994). This interaction between the cadherins and catenins is essential for cadherin-mediated adhesion and association of the complex with the cytoskeleton. Based on the structural similarity between PTPtx and the cadherins, we postulated that PTPp. may interact with cadherins and catenin-like molecules (Tonks et al., 1992). Here, we have examined protein-protein interactions involving PTPp~, and have demonstrated that the cadherins and a- and [3-catenin coimmunoprecipitated with PTPI~ from lysates of rat heart, lung, and brain, as well as mink lung MvLu cells. In vitro binding studies indicated that the intracellular segment of PTPtx bound directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, but not to c~- or [3-catenin. We have demonstrated by immunocytochemistry that PTP~, cadherins, and catenins were localized at points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells, and thus are in the appropriate subcellular location to interact in vivo. After pervanadate treatment of MvLu cells, which inhibits cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity, the PTP~-associated cadherins accumulated in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form. These results indicate that PTPIx may regulate the phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in cadherins and catenins, and thus may also regulate their function.  as described (Brady-Kalnay et al., 1993), harvested 3 d after infection by centrifugation, and lysed in Triton buffer as described below.  Antibodies An mAb to the intracellular segment of PTPI~ (SBK15) and a monoclonal anti-peptide antibody toward the extracellular segment of PTPIx (BK2) have been described previously (Brady-Kalnay et al., 1993; Brady-Kalnay and Tonks, 1994b). Polyclonal antibodies to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and a-catenin (RAC) were generated as described (Rimm et al., 1995a). A polyclonal antibody against 13-catenin (RBC) was generated using full-length protein fused to GST as the antigen, mAbs to ~- (TAC) and t3-catenin (TBC) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal (MPan) and polyclonal (RPan) pan cadherin antibodies, which react with the conserved COOH-terminal 24 amino acids of the cadherin cytoplasmic domain, and nonspecific mouse IgG were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Generally, mAbs to the cadherins and catenins were used for immunoprecipitation, while the polyclonal antibodies were used for immunoblotting. AntiEGF receptor antibodies and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies were incubated with protein A or protein G beads (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc., Piscataway, N J) for 2 h at room temperature, then washed three times with PBS (9.5 mM phosphate, 137 mM NaC1, pH 7.5) before incubation with the lysates. For immunoprecipitation, purified mAbs were used at 0.6 ~g of IgG/~l beads, ascites fluid was used at 1 Ixg of IgG/Ixl beads, and polyclonal serum was used at 3 o,g of IgG//~l beads.  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting For most experiments, MvLu cells were lysed in Triton-containing buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 5 ~,g/ml leupeptin, 5 Ixg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM benzamidine, 200 p~M phenylarsine oxide, 1 mM vanadate, and 0.1 mM molybdate) and scraped off the dish. In selected experiments, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (20 m M Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaC1, 10 mM KC1, 1% NP-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 Ixg/ml leupeptin, 5 ~g/ml aprotinin, 1 mM benzamidine, 200 IxM phenylarsine oxide, 1 mM vanadate, and 0.1 mM molybdate). Tissue lysates were prepared by homogenization in Triton-containing buffer. After incubation on ice for 30 rain, the lysate was centrifuged at 5,000 g for 5 rain, and the Triton-soluble material was recovered in the supernatant. The amount of protein was determined by the Bradford method using BSA as a standard. Immunoprecipitates were prepared from 400 I~g of protein from a Triton-soluble lysate using primary antibody that had been coupled to beads. The immunoprecipitates were centrifuged, and the supernatant ("cleared fraction") and the beads were separated. For the supernatant, 4 x sample buffer was added (to a final concentration of 1X) and boiled at 95°C for 5 min. The beads were washed four times in Tritonor RIPA-containing buffer, and the bound material was eluted by addition of 100 ~1 of 2X sample buffer and boiling for 5 min at 95°C. One-fifth of the immunoprecipitation (IP) (20 ixl) was loaded per lane of the gel, the proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 6% SDS polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting as described previously (Brady-Kalnay et al., 1993).  GST Constructs and Overlay Blots  Materials and Methods Cells MvLu cells were grown as previously described (Brady-Kalnay et al., 1993). The trypsin treatments that cleave and/or preserve the extracellular segment of the cadherins at the cell surface (originally described by Takeichi, 1977) were performed on intact cells as described by Brackenbury et al. (1981). Briefly, three treatments were used: (1) 1 m M E D T A only; (2) LTE (0.002% trypsin plus 1 mM EDTA); (3) TCa ÷+ (0.04% trypsin plus 10 mM calcium chloride). Trypsin was inhibited before cell lysis by the addition of lima bean trypsin inhibitor in a sixfold excess by weight. Pervanadate was generated by mixing hydrogen peroxide and sodium vanadate in a 1:1 molar ratio (Maher, 1993). Cells were treated by addition of 10 or 50 p,M (final concentration) pervanadate to the cell medium for 1 h at 37°C before lysis. Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses  GST was expressed and purified as described (Brady-Kalnay et al., 1993). GST fusion proteins were generated as follows: a construct encoding the COOH-terminal 151 amino acids of E-cadherin was synthesized by PCR and cloned into pGEX-2T. Full-length cDNA for et-catenin was isolated as described (Rimm et al., 1994), and subcloned into pGEX-KT (Hakes and Dixon, 1992). The entire coding sequence of 13-catenin was amplified by RT-PCR using primers based on the sequence in Genbank for human 13-catenin, and a fusion protein was made by subcloning into pGEX-KT. Fusion constructs of both the NH2-terminal (residues 1-375) and COOHterminal (residues 315-781) segments of 13-catenin with GST were also generated by RT-PCR, and subcloned into pGEX-KT. Expression of GST-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli was induced by isopropylthio-[3D-galactoside (IPTG). The bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min, and lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 ixg/ml leupeptin, 5 p,g/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM benzamidine, sonicated and centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min again to remove debris. The supernatant was passed over glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology  The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 130, 1995  978  Published August 1, 1995  Inc.) washed, and the bound protein eluted with 10 mM glutathione as described previously (Brady-Kalnay et al., 1993). A GST antibody was used for detection of these fusion proteins. For overlay blots, protein samples were resolved by electrophoresis (on 10% gels), and transferred to nitrocellulose as described above. The immobilized protein was partially renatured by washing the blot three times for a total of 4 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (660 mM NaCI, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween). The protein probe was added to the blot at 10 ixg/ml in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk, and incubated at 4°C overnight. The blot was washed four times in TBST to remove uncomplexed probe. Bound probe was detected immunologically by enhanced chemiluminescence.  Immunocytochemistry All chemicals were diluted in PBS. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). The cells were permeabilized with 0.5% saponin, blocked with 5% normal goat serum, and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS containing 0.5% saponin, and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Cappel Research Products, Durham, NC) for 1 h. The fluorescent staining was examined using an oil immersion objective, magnification, 63, of a microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped for epifluorescence.  Results Cadherin and Catenin Expression in a Lung Cell Line In light of the structural similarity between the juxtamembrane segment of PTPtx and the intracellular segment of the cadherins, we examined whether PTPtx associates with the cadherin/catenin complex in MvLu cells, which express PTP~ endogenously (Brady-Kalnay et al., 1993). The PTPIx protein exists in vivo in both a full-length form and a form that is proteolytically processed into two noncovalently associated fragments, one of which (E subunit) contains most of the extracellular segment while the other fragment (P subunit) contains a small portion of extracellular segment, the transmembrane domain, and the entire intracellular segment (Brady-Kalnay and Tonks, 1994b). The full-length form of PTPtx migrates at ~200 kD while each of the cleaved fragments migrate at ~100 kD upon SDS-PAGE. The full-length form and the E subunit reacted with an antibody generated against the extracellular segment of PTPtx (Fig. 1 A).  As expected from published observations, antibodies to a-catenin recognized a protein of ~100 kD (Fig. 1 B), whereas antibodies to l~-catenin recognized a protein of N90 kD (Fig. 1 C) in immunoblots of MvLu cell lysates. The pancadherin antibody, which w a s generated against the highly conserved COOH-terminal 24 amino acids of N-cadherin, reacts with most classical cadherins (Geiger et al., 1990). In MvLu cells, this antibody recognized two species (130 and 116 kD) on an immunoblot (Fig. 1 D, lane E), but only immunoprecipitated the 130-kD protein from Triton buffer lysates (see Fig. 2 B, lane C). To verify that these proteins that are immunoreactive to the pancadherin antibody behave as cadherins, we analyzed their sensitivity to trypsinization in the presence or absence of calcium. This test is based on the original description of calcium-independent versus calcium-dependent adhesion molecules (Takeichi, 1977). In this procedure, the extracellular segment of the cadherins (calcium-dependent adhesion molecules) is protected from trypsinization by the presence of calcium, but cleaved in the absence of calcium. The cleavage of the cadherins coincides with these proteins being rendered nonfunctional in aggregation assays (Takeichi, 1977; Brackenbury et al., 1981). As shown in Fig. 1 D (lane L), the proteins that are reactive to the pancadherin antibody are cleaved by trypsin in the absence of calcium. The fragment that appeared in this lane could be resolved into two bands on an 8% gel (data not shown), suggesting that both cadherins are susceptible to tryptic cleavage in the absence of calcium. The 130-kD band is protected from trypsinization in the presence of calcium (lane T). As has been reported for cadherin 5 (Tanihara et al., 1994), the l l 6 - k D form appears to be more sensitive to trypsinization in the presence of calcium, however, analysis of immunoprecipitates indicates that it is partially protected (data not  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Figure1. Characterization of PTP~, cadherin, a-catenin and f3-catenin in MvLu cells. This figure shows immunoblots of lysates from MvLu cells. Each lane contains 15 ixg of lysate protein. A was probed with an antibody (BK2) to the extracellular segment of PTP~; B, an antibody (TAC) to c~-catenin; C, an antibody (TBC) to 13-catenin; D, an antibody (RPan) to cadherin. In panel D, immunoblots of lysates from MvLu cells treated with EDTA alone (E), low trypsin plus EDTA (L), or trypsin plus calcium (T) are presented. The two cadherins were degraded by trypsin in the absence of calcium (L) while the 130-kD band was protected from trypsinization by the presence of calcium (T).  Figure 2. PTPIX,cadherins, and a- and [3-catenin are associated in a complex in MvLu cells. This figure illustrates IP immunoblots of lysates from MvLu cells using mouse IgG (M), PTPIx (Ix), cadherin (C), a-catenin (tx) or 13-catenin (13) antibodies for immunoprecipitation. These immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDSPAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies to PTP~ (SK15; A), cadherins (RPan; B), a-catenin (RAC; C), or 13-catenin (RBC; D). PTPIx immunoprecipitates contained cadherins and ct- and 13-catenin.  Brady-Kalnay et al. PTP~ Associates with Cadherins and Catenins  979  Published August 1, 1995  shown). In light of the reaction with anti-cadherin antibodies and the response to trypsinization, it appears that the 130- and ll6-kD proteins are members of the cadherin superfamily.  PTPtz Associates with Cadherins and Catenins In Vivo We analyzed protein/protein interactions by IP immunoblots, in which proteins are immunoprecipitated with antibodies coupled to beads, the bound material is eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with various antibodies by immunoblotting. Both the full-length (200-kD) and the cleaved (100-kD) forms of PTPIX were immunoprecipitated by antibodies to the extracellular segment of PTPlx (Fig. 2 A, lane Ix), but not by mouse IgG (lane M). When immunoprecipitates of PTPIx were probed on immunoblots with anti-pancadherin antibodies, an association between the 130- and ll6-kD cadherin and PTPIx was detected (Fig. 2 B, lane Ix). Only the 130-kD cadherin was immunoprecipitated by antipancadherin antibody (Fig. 2 B, lane C). The lower band in Fig. 2 B, lane C is nonspecific; it cross-reacted with the goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and was also seen when other rabbit primary antibodies were used. Immunoprecipitates of [3-catenin also contained both the 130- and 116-kD cadherins (Fig. 2 B, lane [3) that were not detected when mouse IgG was used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 B, lane M). Similarly, an association between PTPIx and ~- and [3-catenin was detected when antibodies to ot-catenin (Fig. 2 C) or [3-catenin (Fig. 2 D) were used as probes in the IP immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 2 C, immunoprecipitates of PTPp. (lane Ix) contain a protein that comigrated with the protein recognized by blotting et-catenin immunoprecipitates with a-catenin antibodies (lane or). Similarly, immunoprecipitates of PTPIx contained a protein that comigrated with [3-catenin, and was recognized by antibodies to [3-catenin (Fig. 2 D, lanes Ix and [3). Neither a- nor [3-catenin were immunoprecipitated with mouse IgG (Fig. 2 C and D, lane M). Based on these data, it appears that we can isolate complexes containing PTPIx, cadherins, et- and [3-catenin in MvLu cells which endogenously express these proteins. We have also observed this complex in rat tissue lysates. Fig. 3 illustrates immunoprecipitates, using mouse IgG (lanes 1, 3, 5) or antibodies to PTPIx (lanes 2, 4, 6), from lung (lanes I and 2), heart (lanes 3 and 4), and brain (lanes 5 and 6). A demonstrates that PTPIx was expressed in all three tissues, and was present both in full-length (200-kD), and proteolytically processed (100-kD) forms. The band that runs below 100 kD is not related to PTPIx, as determined by its failure to react with other PTPIx antibodies; it cross-reacted with the secondary antibody on IP immunoblots. As shown in B, proteins of different molecular weights that were reactive to the pan-cadherin antibody coimmunoprecipitated with PTPIx in the three tissues. Using specific antibodies, we have identified two of the cadherins associated with PTPIx in lung as E-cadherin and cadherin 4 (data not shown). Similar to the pattern of association observed in the MvLu mink lung cell line, we also detected a- and [3-catenin in immunoprecipitates of PTPIx from rat lung (lane 2, C and D). We only detected [3-catenin in the complex with PTPIx and cadherin in heart and  Figure 3. PTPIx, cadherins, ct-, and 13-catenin are associated in lung, heart, and brain tissue. This figure represents IP immunoblots from lysates of lung (lanes 1 and 2), heart (lanes 3 and 4) and brain (lanes 5 and 6). Lanes 1, 3, and 5 are immunoprecipitates using mouse IgG. Lanes 2, 4, and 6 are immunoprecipitates using antibody (BK2) to the extracellular domain of PTP~. The immunoblot in A was probed with antibody (SK15) to PTPp, The immunoblot in B was probed with antibody (RPan) to cadherin. C and D were probed with antibodies (RAC and RBC) to et- and [3-catenin, respectively. PTP~ was found associated with cadherins and [3-catenin in all three tissues, a-catenin was only observed to coprecipitate with PTPIx in lung tissue. brain. As seen in Fig. 3 D, the amount of [3-catenin present in the PTPIX immunoprecipitates from the different tissues is variable. The amount of a- and [3-catenin associated with PTPIX does not reflect the total amount of these proteins in the tissues. Thus, (x-catenin is present at similar levels in all three tissues, and the highest amount of [3-catenin associated with PTPIX is observed in lung, even though of the tissues examined, [3-catenin is actually most abundant in brain (data not shown). Since a-catenin associates with PTPIX indirectly, through its interaction with [3-catenin (see Fig. 6), the presence or absence of e~-catenin in the complex may be determined by the level of [3-catenin. Whether this reflects differential regulation of the complex between tissues remains to be established. In the preceding analyses using antibody to the extracellular segment of PTPIX, cadherins and catenins coimmunoprecipitated with the phosphatase. However, we wanted to verify that this reflects the isolation of a multiprotein complex, rather than the presence of a cross-reacting epitope in the various proteins. Therefore, we examined whether the complex could be isolated under conditions of increased stringency after lysis of the cells in a RIPA buffer containing detergents 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% deoxycholate. Mouse IgG does not immunoprecipitate PTPIX or the cadherins (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 1 and 3). Anti-PTPIX antibodies immunoprecipitated both fulllength and cleaved forms of the phosphatase from either Triton or RIPA buffer lysates (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 4). Anti-PTPIX immunoprecipitates from Triton buffer lysates also contained cadherins (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), whereas cadherins were not found in the immunoprecipitates from RIPA buffer lysates (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). Fig. 4 C demonstrates that equal amounts of cadherins were present in both the Triton and RIPA cell extracts. Equivalent results were observed for both et- and [3-catenin, i.e., they were  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 130, 1995  980  Published August 1, 1995  from the Triton buffer lysates (Fig. 5 A, lane 2) but not R I P A buffer lysates (Fig. 5 B, lane 2) after immunoprecipitation with anti-PTPp, antibodies.  Analysis of the Binding Interactions between PTPtz, Cadherins, and Catenins In Vitro To define which segments of PTPIx, the cadherins, and the catenins were involved in complex formation, we set up the following overlay assays to detect binding interactions in vitro (for review see Carr and Scott, 1992). In overlay assays, proteins are subjected to electrophoresis on S D S - P A G E gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, renatured, and protein probes are added in solution to the blot. The protein probe binds to its partner on the nitrocellulose filter and the bound protein is detected with a specific primary antibody followed by a secondary antibody and chemiluminescence. Fig. 6 A illustrates an immunoblot with anti-GST antibody to demonstrate that the various fusion proteins were expressed and migrated at the appropriate apparent molecular weight after S D S - P A G E . Control overlay blots demonstrated that [3-catenin bound both to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin and to a-catenin (B), whereas et-catenin bound Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Figure 4. The complex of cadherins and PTPp~ is not stable to extraction in SDS-containing RIPA buffer. A and B show immunoblots using antibodies to PTPp, (SK15) or cadherins (RPan), respectively. C is an immunoblot using antibody (RPan) to cadherin. Mouse IgG was used for immunoprecipitation in lanes 1 and 3 (A and B). PTPIx antibody (BK2) was used for immunoprecipitation in lanes 2 and 4. PTP~ was immunoprecipitated in both Triton (A, lane 2) and RIPA buffers (A, lane 4). Cadherins were only associated with PTPIx in Triton buffer (B, lane 2) but not RIPA buffer (B, lane 4). C shows that equal amounts of cadherins were present in both Triton (lane 1) and RIPA (lane 2) buffer lysates. only recovered in PTPp, immunoprecipitates from Triton buffer lysates, and not when R I P A buffer was used to lyse the cells (data not shown). These data suggest that the P T P ~ antibodies do not cross-react with the cadherins, and that the cadherins and catenins were found in immunoprecipitates of the phosphatase because they are associated with PTPIx or an additional protein that also binds to PTPp, To determine the fraction of total cadherin that was associated with PTPIx in these cells, we determined how much cadherin remained in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation using various antibodies. In this procedure, IPs were performed, and the proteins that remained in the supernatant after the beads were removed ("cleared fraction") were compared by immunoblotting. W h e n various control antibodies were used, no cadherin was cleared from the supernatant (Fig. 5, lanes 1, 3, 4). However, a substantial amount ( ~ 8 0 % ) of both cadherins was cleared  Figure 5. PTPtx associates with &amp;gt;80% of total cellular cadherin. A and B illustrate immunoblots using antibody (RPan) to cadherin. The lysates represent cleared fractions, i.e., the cadherin that remained in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation with the antibodies indicated at the bottom of B. A shows that the amount of cadherin in the Triton lysate was unaffected by mouse IgG or two other nonspecific mAbs (control). Immunoprecipitation with PTPIx cleared N80% of cadherin from the Triton lysate. The cadherin antibody cleared ~90% of the 130-kD form from the Triton lysate. B shows that only cadherin antibody precipitated cadherin from RIPA buffer lysates. A complex of PTPIx and cadherin was not recovered from lysates prepared in RIPA buffer.  Figure 6. The intracellular domain of PTPIx binds to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin in vitro. A is an immunoblot using anti-GST antibody to demonstrate that the fusion proteins were expressed and migrated at the appropriate apparent molecular weight. Overlay blots (B-F) demonstrate that 13-catenin bound to both the intracellular domain of E-cadherin and c~-catenin (B) while c~-catenin bound only to the NH2 terminus of 13-catenin, which is found in both full-length and the NH2-terminal construct of [3-catenin (C). Overlay blots using PTPIx as the protein probe demonstrated that PTPIx bound to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin (D) and that the binding was blocked by preincubation of the PTPIx probe with soluble E-cadherin (E). If a chimeric molecule, which contained the intracellular segment of PTPIx fused to the extracellular segment of the EGF receptor, was used as the protein probe in the overlay blot, and detected with an antibody to the EGF receptor, it was also observed to bind to E-cadherin (F), indicating that it is the intracellular domain of PTPp, that mediates association.

PTP~AssociateswithCadherinsand Catenins  981  Published August 1, 1995  only to 13-catenin (C). The binding site for et-catenin was in the NH2-terminal segment of [3-catenin (C). When PTPp, was used as the protein probe in the overlay blots, we observed that the phosphatase bound to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin but did not bind a- or 13-catenin (D). If PTPtx was preincubated with the intracellular domain of E-cadherin before addition to the overlay blot, the binding to E-cadherin on the blot was blocked (E). A chimeric molecule containing the intracellular segment of PTPtx fused to the extracellular segment of the E G F receptor, was used as the probe in the overlay blot and detected using anti-EGF receptor antibodies. This probe also bound to E-cadherin (F), demonstrating that it is the intracellular segment of PTP~ that binds to the intracellular segment of E-cadherin. These data indicate that PTPtx and cadherins interact directly both in vivo and in vitro.  Immunocytochemistry Confirms the Localization of PTPtx, Cadherins, and Catenins at Points of Cell~Cell Contact Cadherins and catenins are located at points of cell-cell contact, including adherens junctions. To determine whether PTPIx displayed a similar distribution, we performed immunocytochemistry on MvLu cells. Fig. 7, A and B, shows an immunocytochemical analysis of subconfluent cultures of MvLu cells. PTPtx was localized at points of cell-cell contact. Interestingly, filopodial extensions that contact adjacent cells also contained PTP~ (Fig. 7, A and B). When cells were plated at higher density, PTPtx was restricted to points of cell-ceU contact (C and D). Antibodies to the cadherins (E and F) and [3-catenin (G and H) also decorated points of cell-cell contact in MvLu cells. Similar staining patterns were observed for a-catenin (data not shown). Double-label immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the distribution of PTPp, cadherins, and catenins directly overlaps at points of cell-cell contact (data not shown). This similarity in their subceUular distribution confirms that under normal physiological levels of expression, these proteins are in the appropriate location to interact with one another in vivo.  treatment of the cells with 50 txM pervanadate. After inhibition of PTP activity, the resultant tyrosine phosphorylation of the cadherins correlated with a retardation in their electrophoretic mobility, which was most pronounced for the ll6-kD molecule (compare the two lanes designated lysate 10 and lysate 50). Immunoprecipitates of PTPt~ from MvLu cell lysates prepared after treatment of the cells with various concentrations of pervanadate, were immunoblotted with the pancadherin antibody. At 10 p~M pervanadate, which exerted little effect on PTP activity, the cadherins that coimmunoprecipitate with PTPp, displayed the expected electrophoretic mobility of the dephosphorylated proteins (see lane PTPI~-IP 10). However, upon treatment of the cells with 50 or 100 ~M pervanadate, which effectively inhibited PTP activity including PTP~, the cadherins recovered in the PTPIx immunoprecipitates displayed retarded electrophoretic mobility (lanes PTPtzIP 50 and 100), similar to that of the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein detected in anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoprecipitates (lane PTYR-IP 50). After treatment of the PTPtx immunoprecipitates with either alkaline phosphatase or a tyrosine-specific phosphatase, PTP1B, the retardation in electrophoretic mobility of the associated cadherins was abolished, and they now migrated at the mobility expected for the unphosphorylated proteins (see lane PTPIx-IP PPase). Interestingly, prolonged incubation of the MvLu cells in 100 ~M pervanadate resulted in a dissociation of the cadherins from FrPix (data not shown). These results suggest that when PTPs, including PTPIx, were inhibited, the associated cadherins become tyrosine phosphorylated. Therefore, the cadherins may be endogenous substrates of FTPtx.  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Discussion Cell--cell adhesion molecules of the cadherin superfamily play a critical role in cytoskeletal organization leading to cell-junction formation and epithelial polarization. Cadherins are not only structural proteins, but also are implicated in signal transduction processes. They function as tumor suppressors, i.e., there is often deletion and/or mutation of members of the cadherin/catenin complex in many types of carcinoma. The cadherins associate, through their intracellular segments, with a number of proteins including a-catenin, 13-catenin, and ~/-catenin/plakoglobin. [3-catenin and "y-catenin/plakoglobin bind directly to the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain, whereas c~-catenin binds to both [3-catenin and actin directly, thus linking this complex to the cytoskeleton. These associations are essential for the adhesive functions of cadherins. 13-catenin also binds to the product of the tumor suppressor gene APC (Rubinfeld et al., 1993; S u e t al., 1993; for review see Hulsken et al., 1994a). E-cadherin and APC appear to compete for the internal armadillo-like repeats of [3-catenin and plakoglobin, and thus their binding appears to be mutually exclusive (Htilsken et al., 1994b; Rubinfeld et al., 1993). Destabilization of adherens junctions and cadherinmediated adhesion correlates with invasion and malignant progression. There is evidence to suggest that phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in some components of the cadherin/catenin complex leads to loss of adhesive function and breakdown of adherens junctions (Htilsken et al., 1994a).  Inhibition of PTPs Leads to an Accumulation of Tyrosine-phosphorylated Cadherins in the Complex with PTPtz To address the physiological significance of this association, we tested the possibility that cadherins may be physiological substrates of PTPIx. At the present time there are no specific inhibitors of PTPtx available. Therefore, we treated MvLu cells with pervanadate, a broad specificity inhibitor of cellular PTPs, including PTPIx, to examine its effect on the phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in cadherins. Treatment of cells with 10 IxM pervanadate had little apparent effect on PTP activity, as indicated by the very weak signal in anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoblots (data not shown). As illustrated in lane 1, only trace amounts of cadherin were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies when MvLu cells were treated with 10 ixM pervanadate (p TYR-IP-IO). In contrast, there was a large increase in the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated cadherins, as determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (pTYR-IP-50), after  TheJournalof CellBiology.Volume130,1995  982  Published August 1, 1995  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  Figure 7. Immunocytochemical localization of PTPIx, cadherins, and [3-catenin in MvLu cells. A, C, E, and G are phase-contrast micrographs of MvLu cells. B, D, F, and H are fluorescence micrographs. Cells stained with antibodies to PTPIx (SK15, A and B) show that it is localized to filopodial extensions of the cells and points of cell-cell contact in subconfluent MvLu cells. When the cells were plated at higher density, PTPp, was also localized at points of cell--cell contact (SK15, C and D). Antibodies to cadherins (MPan, E and F) and ~-catenin antibody (TBC, G and H) also showed localization to cell contact sites.  Brady-Kalnay et al. PTPI~ Associates with Cadherins and Catenins  983  Published August 1, 1995  Presumably, these proteins are normally maintained in a dephosphorylated state through the action of a phosphatase, which is crucial for the stabilization of adhesion and adherens junctions. Here we demonstrate that PTPtx, cadherins, and catenins exist in a complex, and localize to points of cell-cell contact. Furthermore, treatment of MvLu cells with pervanadate, which is a general inhibitor of PTP activity including PTP~, leads to an accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated cadherin in the complex with PTPtx, indicating that the cadherins may be an endogenous substrate of PTP~. Our results suggest that PTPIx may be one of the enzymes that regulate the dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation of the cadherin/catenin complex, and thus its interaction with the cytoskeleton. The most commonly used model systems for analysis of cadherin function include MDCK, A431, MCF-7, and L cells. However, as assessed by immunoblotting, these cells do not express significant levels of PTP~ (data not shown). PTPIx displays a restricted tissue distribution. It is particularly prevalent in lung, hence our choice of MvLu cells in which to examine physiological function. Nevertheless, we have also observed complex formation between PTPIx, cadherins, and catenins in primary rat tissues including lung, heart, and brain, which also express PTP~ endogenously. In fact, in lung we have identified two of the cadherins as E-cadherin and cadherin 4. Furthermore, we have demonstrated direct binding in vitro between the intracellular segments of PTPtx and E-cadherin. Our data clearly suggest that at least in these tissues in which it is expressed, PTPtx may regulate the function of the cadherin/ catenin complex. The implication is that there may be  Figure 8. Inhibition of cellular PTPs by pervanadate resulted in  an accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated cadherin associated with PTPI~. This figure is an immunoblot, probed with cadherin antibody (RPan), of lysates and IPs from MvLu cells treated with 10 ixM (10), 50 ixM (50) or 100 txM (100) pervanadate. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies only precipitated cadherin from cells treated with 50 IxM pervanadate in which cellular PTPs had been inhibited. Lysates from cells treated with 10 and 50 I~M pervanadate show that there is a retardation in the electrophoretic mobility of the cadherins that correlates with tyrosine phosphorylation (lysate 50 ixM). Immunoprecipitates of PTPIx from cells treated with 50 or 100 I~M pervanadate contain cadherins that display retarded electrophoretic mobility (lanes 50 and 100 under PTPp.IP). Treatment of the immunoprecipitates with either alkaline phosphatase or PTP1B restored the normal electrophoretic mobility of the cadherins (PPase). Thus, when cellular PTPs were inhibited, the cadherin associated with PTPI~ was tyrosine phosphorylated.  other PTPs regulating tyrosyl phosphorylation of cadherins and catenins in other cell types. In this regard, it is interesting to note that a homologue of PTP~, termed PTP~, has been described, that displays 77% overall similarity at the amino acid level, and a much broader expression pattern than PTPtx (Jiang et al., 1993). Whether PTPK also interacts with cadherins and catenins remains to be established. There is now a substantial body of information that points to the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in the control of the integrity of cell junctions and the function of the cadherin/catenin complex. The cadherins localize to adherens junctions which are points of cell-cell contact at which the a¢tin cytoskeleton is anchored (for review see Geiger and Ayalon, 1992). Cell junctions are dynamic structures, and are areas of rapid phosphotyrosine turnover in normal cells (Volberg et al., 1991). PTKs such as src localize to these areas and phosphorylate junctional proteins in both normal and transformed cells (Maher et al., 1985; Tsukita et al., 1991). Aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation induced by expression of v-src causes loss of adherens junctions, although tight junctions and desmosomes appear to be unaffected (Warren and Nelson, 1987; Volberg et al., 1992). However, the adherens junctions were able to reform after addition of tyrphostins (PTK inhibitors) to the src-transformed cells (Volberg et al., 1992). Furthermore, inhibition of PTPs in M D C K cells by treatment with pervanadate caused dramatic accumulation of phosphotyrosyl proteins at adherens junctions (Volberg et al., 1992). This led to a deterioration of the adherens junctions with concomitant increase in the number and size of focal contacts, thus indicating differential effects of phosphorylation on junctional structures (Volberg et al., 1992). Thus, the stability of adherens junctions depends upon the balance between the action of PTKs and PTPs. PTKs, such as members of the src family, have the potential to disrupt tissue architecture by phosphorylating cell junction or cytoskeletal proteins. The PTPs that antagonize these effects will also be crucial components of the systems for control of junctional integrity. The structural features of PTPtx and its association with cadherins and catenins suggest that this RPTP may localize to adherens-type junctions and serve such a regulatory function. Several studies have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of cadherins and catenins suppresses cadherin-mediated adhesion and suggest that phosphorylation may play a role in association of the complex with the cytoskeleton (for review see Kemler, 1993). In rat fibroblasts transformed either by v-src or v-src in combination with v-fos, 13-catenin was heavily phosphorylated on tyrosyl residues (Matsuyoshi et al., 1992). This coincided with a change in the morphology of aggregates of these cells from a compact, firmly connected appearance in the untransformed state to a much looser association of the transformed cells. Interestingly, treatment of these cells with herbimycin A, a PTK inhibitor, inhibited 13-catenin phosphorylation, and induced tighter aggregation of the transformed cells, whereas vanadate, a PTP inhibitor, inhibited cadherin-mediated aggregation (Matsuyoshi et al., 1992). A similar observation was made in chick embryo fibroblasts transformed with Rous sarcoma virus. Expression of p60 v.... suppressed cadherin-mediated adhesion, an effect that correlated with the  Downloaded from jcb.rupress.org on November 6, 2009  The Journalof Cell Biology,Volume130, 1995  984  Published August 1, 1995  tyrosine phosphorylation of N-cadherin and c~- and I~-catenin (Hamaguchi et al., 1993). Again these effects were reversed by herbimycin A. In addition, kinase-active but transformation-defective mutants of p60 vsrc neither suppressed cadherin-mediated adhesion, nor phosphorylated N-cadherin and the associated catenins. A temperaturesensitive v - s r c mutant induced tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin and [3-catenin at the permissive temperature in MDCK cells that correlated with a loss of cell-cell contacts and an increase in invasion (Behrens et al., 1993). Thus, the suppression of adhesion and the correlative s r c induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cadherins and catenins appears to be highly specific for transformation. These studies indicate a critical role for the balanced action of PTKs and PTPs in regulating the adhesive function of cadherins, suggesting that a PTP, such as PTPtx, may stabilize adhesion by promoting dephosphorylation of the cadherins and catenins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the cadherin/catenin complex has been observed not only in transformed cells as described above, but also under normal physiological conditions. Stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation by hepatocyte growth factor or EGF results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of 13-catenin and plakoglobin (Shibamoto et al., 1994). Furthermore, the EGF receptor has been shown to bind directly to 13-catenin in vitro, and to associate with the cadherin/catenin complex in epithelial cells (Hoschuetzky et al., 1994). Recently it was shown that the c-erbB-2 gene product also associates with catenins in cancer cells (Ochiai et al., 1994). Our demonstration of the association of PTPtx with cadherins suggests a regulatory balance to the tyrosine kinases to permit rapid reversible tyrosine phosphorylation and modulation of the strength of cadherin driven adhesive reactions during processes such as migration and cell division. In addition, our data and others suggest that, for adhesion in normal cells, the cadherins are normally maintained in a dephosphorylated state, at least in part by PTPIx. The potential importance of a cadherin associated PTP similar to FYPI~ is clear when one considers that tyrosine phosphorylation of the cadherin/catenin complex can lead to loss of cell--cell adhesion, transformation, and metastasis.

																															<Abstract>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily. Several members of this family have been shown to transduce their signals through binding to type I and type II serine-(threonine) kinase receptors. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for BMPs (BMPR-II), which is distantly related to DAF-4, a BMP type II receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. In transfected COS-1 cells, osteogenic protein (OP)-1/BMP-7, and less efficiently BMP-4, bound to BMPR-II. BMPR-II bound ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. Binding of OP-1/BMP-7 to BMPR-II was also observed in nontransfected cell lines. Moreover, a transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR-II in the presence of type I receptors after stimulation by OP-1/BMP-7.</Abstract>

																															<Abstract>The cdc25 phosphatases play key roles in cell cycle progression by activating cyclin-dependent kinases. Two members of the 14-3-3 protein family have been isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify proteins that interact with the human cdc25A and cdc25B phosphatases. Genes encoding the human homolog of the 14-3-3 epsilon protein and the previously described 14-3-3 beta protein have been isolated in this screening. 14-3-3 proteins constitute a family of well-conserved eukaryotic proteins that were originally isolated in mammalian brain preparations and that possess diverse biochemical activities related to signal transduction. We present evidence that indicates that cdc25 and 14-3-3 proteins physically interact both in vitro and in vivo. 14-3-3 protein does not, however, affect the phosphatase activity of cdc25A. Raf-1, which is known to bind 14-3-3 proteins, has recently been shown to associate with cdc25A and to stimulate its phosphatase activity. 14-3-3 protein, however, has no effect on the cdc25A-kinase activity of Raf-1. Instead, 14-3-3 may facilitate the association of cdc25 with Raf-1 in vivo, participating in the linkage between mitogenic signaling and the cell cycle machinery.</Abstract>

																															<Abstract>The hereditary disease Cockayne syndrome (CS) is characterized by a complex clinical phenotype. CS cells are abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and are defective in the repair of transcriptionally active genes. The cloned CSB gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast Snf2 protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator Swi/Snf. We report the cloning of the CSA cDNA, which can encode a WD repeat protein. Mutations in the cDNA have been identified in CS-A cell lines. CSA protein interacts with CSB protein and with p44 protein, a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH. These observations suggest that the products of the CSA and CSB genes are involved in transcription.</Abstract>

Body weight tends to be affected more severely than body length, leading to a characteristic appearance of so-called cachectic dwarfism. All CS patients develop neurological symptoms or signs, of which the most common are mental retardation and microcephaly (Nance and Berry, 1992). The majority of CS patients also suffer ophthalmic changes, in particular pigmentary degeneration of the retina and cataracts. Dental abnormalities are common, and about 75% of patients manifest abnormal sensitivity to sunlight. The mean age of death in 34 cases was -12 years, but some patients have survived into their teens and twenties (Nance and Berry, 1992). Laboratory tests are not diagnostic. However, increased ventricular size, cerebral atrophy, or both, as well as calcification of the basal ganglia, are frequently observed by computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Histopathology of the brain at autopsy typically reveals patchy demyelination of subcortical matter (Nance and Berry, 1992). The observation of photosensitivity in many cases of CS prompted studies of radiation sensitivity at the cellular level. Lymphoblastoid and fibroblast cell lines from all known CS patients have increased sensitivity to killing by ultraviolet (UV) radiation at -254 nm (Schmickel et al., 1977; Andrews et al., 1978; Hoar and Waghorne, 1978; Wade and Chu, 1979; Marshall et al., 1980; Lehmann et al., 1993). Conventional measurements of nucleotide excision repair, the repair mode primarily involved in the repair of DNA damage produced by UV radiation, indicate no defect in CS cells (reviewed by Friedberg et al., 1995). However, in contrast with normal human cells, which perform nucleotide excision repair of the template (transcribed) strand of transcriptionally active genes at a faster rate than the coding (nontranscribed) strand, CS cells fail to show this kinetic difference and are considered to be defective in strand-specific repair of transcriptionally active genes (Mullenders et al., 1992; van Hoffen et al., 1993). This phenotype may also be reflected in the observation that CS cells are defective in the reactivation of the expression of a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene when this gene is inactivated by irradiation of the plasmid prior to transfection of cells (Schweiger et al., 1987; Barrett et al., 1991). CS cells in culture suffer a significant delay in the recovery of bulk DNA and RNA synthesis following exposure to UV radiation (Lehmann et al., 1979; Lehmann, 1982; Mayne and Lehmann, 1982; Sugita et al., 1987; Lehmann et al., 1993). The delayed kinetics of the recovery of RNA synthesis have been exploited for complementation analysis in heterodikaryons derived by fusion of cells from different CS patients. This analysis has defined two genetic complementation groups, designated CS-A and CS-B (Tanaka et al., 1981; Lehmann, 1982). A human gene (originally called ERCCG) was isolated by correction of the UV sensitivity of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line designated UV81 (Troelstraet al., 1990). Subsequent studies showed that the ERCCG gene corrects the cellular phenotypes of  Summary The hereditary disease Cockayne syndrome (CS) is characterized by a complex clinical phenotype.

The cloned CSB gene encodes a member of a protein family that includes the yeast SnfP protein, a component of the transcriptional regulator SwilSnf. We report the cloning of the CSA cDNA, which can encode a WD repeat protein. Mutations in the cDNA have been identified in CS-A cell lines. CSA protein. interacts with CSB protein and with p44 protein, a subunit of the human RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH. These observations suggest that the products of the CSA and CSB genes are involved in transcription. Introduction Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized primarily by postnatal failure of growth and progressive neurological dysfunction (reviewed by Friedberg et al., 1995). A recent comprehensive review of the clinical features of 140 cases (Nance and Berry, 1992) indicates that growth failure is a cardinal clinical feature in all cases and generally manifests in the first `Present address: Laboratory of Gene Transfer, National Human Genome Research, National institutes of Health, Maryland 20892. Center for Bethesda,  Cdl 556  CS-6 cells, but is without effect on the UV sensitivity of CS-A cells, or cells from the nucleotide excision repairdefective disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) (Troelstra et al., 1992). Sequence analysis of the ERCC6 gene from CS-B patients has revealed the presence of mutations (Troelstra et al., 1992; D. Mallery and A. R. L., unpublished data). In light of these observations and in keeping with recent nomenclatural recommendations (Lehmann et al., 1994) the fRCC6 gene is now referred to as CSB. The molecular basis of the complex clinical phenotype of CS is unknown. Here we report the molecular cloning of the human CSA gene by functional complementation of CSA cells. A CSA cDNA uniquely and specifically corrects UV sensitivity and defective CA Tgene reactivation in CS-A cells. Additionally, mutations have been identified in CSA cDNAs of all CS-A cell lines examined, including an identical mutation in two CS-A siblings. The CSA gene is expected to encode a polypeptide of 396 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of -44 kDa. The predicted amino acid sequence of the putative CSA protein indicates that it is a WD repeat (WD-40 repeat) protein (reviewed by Neer et al., 1994). In vitro translated CSA protein specifically interacts with CSB protein and with p44 protein, a subunit of the RNA polymerase II basal transcription factor TFIIH (Drapkin et al., 1994; Roy et al., 1994; Mu et al., 1995; Aboussekhra et al., 1995). These observations, coupled with the observation that the amino acid sequence of the predicted CSB polypeptide is homologous with a component of the yeast Swi/Snf transcriptional activation complex, suggest that CS cells may be defective in RNA polymerase II transcription. Results Functional Complementation of CS-A Cells A human cDNA library constructed from size-fractionated cDNA cloned in an episomal plasmid vector (Legerski and Peterson, 1992) was screened for functional complementation of the UV radiation-sensitive phenotype of CS-A cells. No UV-resistant colonies were obtained after the screening of - 400,000 hygromycin-resistant colonies obtained by electroporation with a fraction enriched for cDNAs &amp;gt;4 kb in size. A single UV-resistant colony was observed after screening - 200,000 hygromycin-resistant colonies with a fraction enriched for cDNA inserts in the 2-4 kb size range. The UV-resistant clonal line was expanded, and the plasmids were rescued to Escherichia coli. Restriction analysis revealed that all the plasmids were identical and contained a cDNA insert of - 2.2 kb. This plasmid is designated pCSA5 and was purified for further analysis. To verify that the increase in resistance to UV radiation was effected by a plasmid-borne element rather than by mutational reversion in the mass culture caused by exposure of the cells to UV light, plasmid pCSA5 was retransfected into CS-A cells. These cells express the EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNAl) protein. Hence, the EBV-based vectors used in these studies replicate autonomously as episomal plasmids, circumventing the need to analyze numerous clonal lines to identify a particu lar  line that expresses the cDNA. A population of -2000 independent transfectants not previously exposed to UV light was analyzed for complementation of the UV sensitivity of CSA cells.

Once again, plasmid pCSA5 conferred enhanced radiation resistance to CS-A cells (Figure 1A). In experiments designed to determine the genetic specificity of this phenotypic complementation, the plasmid was also transfected into CSB cells and cells from XP genetic complementation group C (XPC). The latter cells are known to be hypersensitive to UV radiation because of a defect in nucleotide excision repair (reviewed by Friedberg et al., 1995). The plasmid did not enhance the UV radiation resistance of either of these cell types, verifying that the UV resistance is specific for CS-A cells (Figures 1A and 1 B). To exclude the possibility that the UV resistance was an artifact of the particular cell line used, plasmid pCSA5 was also electroporated into the CS-A lymphoblastoid cell line GM2964 derived from a different CS-A individual. Once again, we observed enhanced UV resistance compared with that in the presence of the vector alone (Figure 1C). This result simultaneously demonstrates that the cloned cDNA complements the CS cellular phenotype in both lymphoblastoid and fibroblast cell lines. The level of phenotypic correction observed with the lymphoblastoid line was not as complete as that observed with SV46-transformed fibroblasts. This may in part reflect limitations of thesurvival procedure used with the lymphoblastoid cells, which were grown in suspension culture (see Experimental Procedures). To confirm that the enhanced resistance to UV radiation correlates with an increased capacity for DNA repair, we measured the ability of cells to reactivate the expression of an inactivated (by exposure to UV radiation) CAT reporter gene. CS-A cells carrying plasmid pCSA5 showed significantly enhanced levels of CAT activity compared with those in the parental cell line (Figure 2). Transfection of CS-B cells with the plasmid did not result in reactivation  Figure cDNA  3.

Sequence Analysis of the CSA cD?4A The cDNA insert of clone pCSA5 (designated as the CSA cDNA) was sequenced on both strands (Figure 3). The first ATG at nucleotide 37 is preceded by G at the -3 position, where a purine residue has been shown to be important for the initiation of translation (Kozak, 1966). An open reading frame that could encode a 396 amino acid polypeptide terminates at nucleotide position 1224, followed by an extended 3' untranslated region. The poly(A) addition signal AATAAA begins at nucleot&amp; position 1966, and a poly(A) tail begins at nucfeotide 2011 (Figure 3). The calculated size of the predicted CSA protein is 44 kDa, with a calculated isoelectric point of 6.32 as determined by the Peptidesort program of Genetics Computer Group. No significant matches were found by searching the GenBank, EMBL, or dbEST databases wtth the CSA cDNA sequence by using the BLASTN program. However, by use of the BLASTX program, significant scores were observed with a number of WD repeat proteins (reviewed by Neer et al., 1994) including the Xenopus laevts f3-Trcp  Cdl 556  Figure 4.

Further analysis of the predicted CSA polypeptide sequence revealed the presence of five WD repeat motifs (Figure 4). In the first repeat, the consensus amino acid sequence G/SIAN, H, which marks the beginning of the repeated motif, is replaced by I, H (Figure 4), and in repeat 5, the consensus sequence WIFN, DIN/ R/K, which denotes the end of the motif, is replaced by W, V (Figure 4). The length of the core between the GH and WD sequences in each repeat of the predicted CSA protein is 34 or 35 amino acids, consistent with the range of 23-41 amino acids observed in other members of this class of proteins (reviewed by Neer et al., 1994). Also consistent with the structure of this class of proteins, two of the five repeats (repeats 2 and 3) have no mismatches with the consensus core repeat sequence (Figure 4) while the remaining three repeats (repeats 1, 4, and 5) each have three or fewer mismatches (Figure 4) (reviewed by Neer et al., 1994). Mutational Analysis of the CSA Gene Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were prepared that facilitated amplification of the CSA coding region in two overlapping segments. The primer pairs used for the amplification of the 5' and 3' halves of CSA cDNAs were designated Ml -M2 and M3-M4, respectively. First-strand cDNAspreparedfrom theCS-Aprimaryfibroblastcell lines CS5BR and CSGBR, the normal primary human fibroblast cell line CCD-42Sk (CRLl513), or HeLa cells were used assubstrates in the PCR reaction. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products derived from CS5BR cDNA by using the Ml-M2 primer pair showed a single band that comigrated with the PCR band derived from HeLa cDNA. This band was gel purified and directly sequenced with an automated sequencer and was found to be completely congruent with the wild-type sequence. Electrophoresis of the PCR products derived from the CSSBR cell line by using the M3-M4 primer pair revealed two CSA-specific bands, both of which migrated faster than the single band derived from the normal human fibroblast cetf line or from HeLa cells (Figure 5A). The faster-migrating band was gel purified and directly sequenced. This analysis revealed a 279 bp deletion in the CSA coding region, starting at nucleotide position 660 and ending at nucleotide position 1156 (Figure 58). The slower-migrating CS5BR band was contaminated by a nonspecific PCR product. Hence, this  band was cloned into the vector pBSII, and two independently isolated clones were sequenced. This analysis demonstrated the presence of an identical 61 bp deletion in the CSA coding region in both clones, starting at nucleotide position 1076 and also ending at nucleotide position 1156 (Figure 58). The same two deletions were identified in CSA cDNA isolated from the cell line CSGBR, derived from a sibling of the CSSBR individual, but not in two other CS-A cell lines examined (data not shown).

These abnormal splice products presumably derive from a homozygous mutation in a splice donor site. Neither deletion creates a frame shift. Hence, the two abnormal transcripts potentially encode internally deleted proteins with predicted sizes of 303 and 369 amino acids. Mutations were also identified in CSA cDNAs in two other CSA primary fibroblast cell lines examined and in the lymphoblastoid line GM2964, the UV sensitivity of which was shown to be corrected by the CSA cDNA (see above). One of these mutations changes codon 322 from TAC (encoding tyrosine) to the stop codon TAA. The details of this mutational analysis will be presented elsewhere (L. L. et al., unpublished data). On the basis of these results, we conclude that the cDNA that complements the cellular phenotypes of CS-A cells is derived from the CSA gene. CSA Protein Interacts with Human CSB Protein and with the p44 Subunit of TFIIH In light of the possibility that the products of the CSA and CSBgenesare involved in the same biochemical or regulatory pathway, or both, we asked whether these polypeptides physically interact. The cloned CSB gene was engineered to express the 9ElO epitope, which is specifically recognized by a monoclonal antibody to the human c-Myc protein (see Experimental Procedures). Following the synthesis of unlabeled epitope-tagged CSB protein and of radiolabeled CSA protein by in vitro transcription and translation of the cloned CSA and CSB cDNAs, the two proteins were observed to coprecipitate in the presence of antibody to the epitope (Figure 6A, lane 2). Only background levels of precipitated CSA protein were observed in the presence of the antibody but in the absence of epitope-tagged CSB protein (Figure 6A, lane 4). The interaction between CSA and CSB proteins was confirmed in vivo by the use of the two-hybrid genetic system (Chien et al., 1991). When yeast cells were transformed with a plasmid carrying the CSA gene fused to the DNA-binding domain in the yeast GAL4 gene, together with one carrying the CSB gene fused to the GAL4 activation domain, 16 Miller units of 6galactosidase were detected. Transformation with either plasmid alone yielded 0.5-l .O units of activity. Radiolabeled CSA protein also coprecipitated with epitope-tagged p44 protein, the 44 kDa subunit of the human RNA polymerase II basal transcription factor TFIIH (Drapkin et al., 1994; Roy et al., 1994; Mu et al., 1995; Aboussekhra et al., 1995) (Figure 6A, lane 3). This interaction was independently confirmed in other experiments (Figure 6B, lane 5), in which it was additionally demonstrated that CSA protein did not coprecipitate with epitope-tagged ~62, xeroderma pigmentosum D (XPD), or XPB proteins, other known components of TFIIH (Drapkin et al., 1994; Roy et al., 1994; Mu et al., 1995; Aboussekhra et al., 1995) (Figure 6B).  tCSA  1234  i  6  CSA,.,,, C 2OL  CS4.,,8 I I + + -19ECSB --9Ep44  11 1+  +  -I   8-= 46-  ___ tCSA  tCSA;.$ 56 76  21-m  c 14-s 1 Figure 6.

CS5BR and CSGBR are known to be the offspring of a consanguineous marriage (A. R. L., unpublished data) and are therefore likely to carry the same mutation in both allelesof the CSA gene. The observation that the deletions  Cell 560  Figure 7.

(6) Southern blot hybridization of EcoRIdigested DNA from human, mouse, hybrid-A5 (a mouse/human hybrid containing human chromosome 5) and hybrid-Al7 (a mouse/human hybrid containing human chromosome 17) with gel-purified CSA cDNA.  To define regions of the CSA polypeptide required for these interactions, we expressed runoff transcripts and translated them in vitro to generate C-terminal deletions of the CSA protein. Truncations of the CSA protein carrying just the N-terminal 146 or 167 amino acids (CSA(l146) and CSA(l-167)) both interacted with p44 and CSB proteins (Figure 6C). Thus, the N-terminal 146 amino acid residues of the CSA protein are apparently sufficient for its interactions with both the p44 subunit of theTFllH complex and the CSB protein. This region of the polypeptide includes the first two of the five WD repeats (see Figure 3). Chromosomal Mapping of the CSA Gene PCR primers designed to produce human-specific products from the 3' untranslated region of the CSA gene were used to amplify DNA from the NIGMS human/rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panel number 2. The 724 bp PCR product was identical to that in the CSA cDNA, indicating that there are no introns in the region of the CSA gene amplified. Following electrophoresis, amplification products were observed in the human control lanes and in the lanes for the chromosome 5 and 6 human/rodent somatic cell hybrids (Figure 7A). The chromosome 6 hybrid (GM16629) has been previously reported to give a positive signal for the primer set C9, which maps to chromosome 5~14~12, indicating that this hybrid also carries portions of chromosome 5 (Dubois and Naylor, 1993). South ern blot hybridization was performed on restictiondigested genomic DNA from human, mouse, hybrid-A5 (a mouse/ human hybrid containing only human chromosome 5) and hybrid-Al7 (a mouse/human hybrid containing human chromosome 17) with gel-purified CSA cDNA (Figure 78). A hybridizing band of 3.2 kb was detected uniquely in human DNA and in the hybrid-A5 DNA, but not in the  mouse or hybrid-Al 7 DNA (Figure 78). A second 9 kb band hybridized to both the mouse and the hybrid-Al7 DNA (Figure 78). To confirm the specificity of the 3.2 kb band for human DNA, a second Southern blot hybridization was performed, using the 724 bp PCR product (nucleotides 1216-l 942 of the GSA cDNA) as a probe. This exclusively yielded the 3.2 kb hybridizing bands in the human and hybrid-A5 lanes (data not shown). Additionally, fluorescent in situ hybridization to human metaphase preparations using biotinylated cDNA as a probe produced a signal exclusively in the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 5 (data not shown). Collectively, these data localize the CSA gene to human chromosome 5. More refined map ping of the CSA gene on chromosome 5 will be reported elsewhere (L. D. M. et al., unpublished data). Discussion The increased sensitivity to UV radiation manifested by CS cells in culture invited a functional strategy for gene cloning. Screening a human expression library in an episomal-based plasmid yielded a cDNA that corrected the UV-sensitive phenotype in both lymphoblastoid and fibroblast lines derived from two different CS-A individuals. This cDNA did not complement the UV sensitivity of cells either from genetic complementation group B or from an individual with the nucleotide excision repair-defective disease XP. This specificity, coupled with the reactivation of defective expression of a UV-inactivated plasmid-borne reporter gene, strongly suggests that the cDNA derives from the CSA gene. Direct confirmation of this suggestion stems from the demonstration of mutations in three different CSA cell lines, and of truncated cDNAs in two other CSA lines that likely represent abnormal splice products conse Cockayne  561  Syndrome  Group  A Gene  quent to a splice donor site mutation. The CSA gene maps to human chromosome 5 and hence is unlinked to the CSB gene, which was previously shown to map to the region lOqll.2 (Troelstra et al., 1992). Sequencing the CSA cDNA revealed that the gene can encode a polypeptide of 44 kDa with the signature features of a WD repeat protein. WD repeat proteins are associated with multiple and diverse aspects of cellular metabolism, including signal transduction, vesicular trafficking, regulation of cytoskeletal assembly, cell cycle regulation, RNA processing, and gene regulation (reviewed by Neer et al., 1994). In general, their functions appear to be regulatory in nature; no WD repeat proteins have been shown to have catalytic functions (reviewed by Neer et al., 1994). Structural models suggest that WD repeat proteins are endowed with the potential for interactions with other proteins, consistent with the fact that many such proteins are components of multiprotein complexes (reviewed by Neer et al., 1994). The molecular basis for the well-established sensitivity of CS cells to UV radiation is not understood. Measurements of nucleotide excision repair in UV-irradiated cells indicate normal repair of base damage in the genome overall. However, both CS-A and CS-6 cells have been shown to be defective in the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in transcriptionally active genes compared with transcriptionally silent regions of the genome (Venema et al., 1990). More refined studies indicate that there is a particularly pronounced defect in nucleotide excision repair of the template (transcribed) strand of transcriptionally active genes (Mullenders et al., 1992; van Hoffen et al., 1993). These results have fostered the notion that the primary defect in CS cells is in the preferential repair of transcriptionally active genes. This model has been reinforced by the observation that the translated amino acid sequences of the human CSB (ERCCG) gene and the E. coli mfd gene (which is believed to be required for the coupling of nucleotide excision repair to sites of arrested transcription) both contain consensus helicase motifs (reviewed by Selby and Sancar, 1994). Hence, it has been suggested that the CSB gene product may function as a transcription repair coupling factor in human cells (reviewed by Selby and Sancar, 1994). It is conceivable that defective repair of transcriptionally active genes might alter levels of gene expression. However, on the basis of present knowledge, it is difficult to imagine how this could selectively affect certain genes, thereby resulting in the specific clinical and cellular phenotypes of CS. Defective repair of UV radiation-induced damage in CS cells is not confined to the template strand of transcriptionally active genes. The rate of removal of pyrimidine dimers from the coding (nontranscribed) strand is also somewhat reduced compared with the rate in normal cells (Mullenders et al., 1992; van Hoffen et al., 1993). Additionally, defective repair of rRNA genes has been observed in CS cells (Christians and Hanawalt, 1994). Hence, it is suggested that the CSA and CSB gene products may play a role in the modulation of chromatin structure during general transcription, thereby facilitating repair in such genes (Christians and Hanawalt, 1994).  The notion that the CSA and CSB proteins are involved in transcription in as yet unidentified ways is supported by several observations. Recent studies have shown that the XfD and XPB genes encode polypeptides that are subunits of the RNA polymerase II basal transcription factor TFIIH (Drapkin et al., 1994; Roy et al., 1994; Mu et al., 1995; Aboussekhra et al., 1995). These (and other components of TFIIH) are bifunctional proteins that participate both in RNA polymerase II transcription initiation and in nucleotide excision repair (Drapkin et al., 1994; Roy et al., 1994; Mu et al., 1995; Aboussekhra et al., 1995). It has been suggested that mutations in these proteins may inactivate their function in nucleotide excision repair, perturb their role in RNA polymerase II transcription initiation, or both (Bootsma and Hoeijmakers, 1993; Friedberg et al., 1994; Vermeulen et al., 1994). Hence, a transcription defect, rather than a defect in DNA repair, may be the primary pathogenetic determinant that results in the complex clinical phenotype of CS associated with mutational inactivation of the XPB or XPD genes. The observation that the clinical features of CS also accompany mutational inactivation of the CSA and CSB genes invites speculation that the polypeptides encoded by these genes also participate in RNA polymerase II transcription. Studies in one of our laboratories (that of E. C. F.) have demonstrated reduced levels of transcription in vitro from several plasmid-borne RNA polymerase II promoters (but not RNA polymerase I or Ill promoters) in extracts of lymphoblastoid cells and fibroblasts from all CS-A and CS-B individuals examined (G. Dianov et al., unpublished data). Similar results have been obtained with extracts of XP cells from genetic complementation group B(G. Dianovet al., unpublisheddata). Thefurtherobservation that the predicted polypeptide product of the CSA gene is a WD repeat protein that interacts with the 44 kDa subunit of TFIIH is also provocative with regard to a role of the CSA gene product in RNA polymerase II transcription. In this regard, it is of interest that the Drosophila melanogaster coactivator dTAFI180, which associates with the basal transcription factor TFIID, has also been shown to be a WD repeat protein (Dynlacht et al., 1993) as has the Tupl protein of S. cerevisiae, which is known to repress the transcription of a variety of genes in yeast (Keleher et al., 1992). CSA protein also interacts with CSB protein. The sequence of a region of -500 amino acids located in the middle of the 1493 amino acid CSB polypeptide shows significant homology with a number of proteins known to be involved in the regulation of gene expression, including the Snf2 protein of S. cerevisiae, a component of the multiprotein SwilSnf transcriptional activation complex (Troelstra et al., 1992). Given the assumption that abnormal basal transcription, activated transcription, or both are indeed primary defects in CS cells, it is not difficult to imagine that such defects might interfere with the efficiency of DNA repair that is coupled to transcription, thereby resulting in a secondary phenotype of defective repair of transcriptionally active genes when cells are exposed to UV radiation. The observation that some individuals with the group G form of XP also manifest typical clinical features of CS  Cell 562  requires that the transcription hypothesis accommoaate some role of the XPG gene in transcription. To date, we know of no direct evidence that speaks directly for or against such a role. However, recent coimmunoprecipitation studies have demonstrated an interaction between in vitro translated XPG and CSB proteins (N. I. and E. C. F., unpublished data). Additionally, the yeast homolog of XPG protein (Rad2) interacts with Ssll protein, the yeast homolog of human p44 protein, which, as shown in the present study, interacts with CSA protein. Finally, it has been suggested that mutations in XPG protein might alter RNA polymerase II transcription by perturbing an interconversion between the form of TFIIH required for RNA polymerase II basal transcription and that required for nucleotide excision repair (Svejstrup et al., 1995). Experimental Procedures  of 1 Jlmz/s. Growth medium was replaced. and plates were incubated until colonies were visible (- 14 days), with feeding as necessary. Plates were fixed and stained with crystal violet, and colony-forming ability was determined. The UV sensitivity of iymphobiast cell lines was quantitated by postirradiation viability (Ctsuka et al., 1984). Cells (2 x 10s) were washed and resuspended in 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and irradiated at a dose rate of 1 J/m2/s in a 35 mm tissue culture dish (in triplicate). The cells were transferred to a 25 cm* flask containing 12 ml of growth medium. After 3 days, the number of viable ceils was determined by trypan blue exclusion. CAT Reactivation Assay pRSVcat DNA was irradiated at a dose rate of 3.6 J/m2/s. Piasmid DNA (10 ng) was eiectroporated with 400 ug of carrier DNA into IOn ceils and plated into 10 ml of growth medium (in triplicate). Later (48 hr), plates were washed with PBS, and cells were scraped into a microfuge tube. Samples were pelleted, resuspended in 0.25 M Tris (pH 7.7) and frozen in dry ice-EtOH, followed by thawing at 37OC, three times. Debris was pelleted for 5 min at 4°C and the supernatant transferred to a new tube. Protein was quantitated by use of Bio-Rad protein reagent. CAT reactions were carried out at 55OC with 20 ng of total protein, 0.2 f&amp;i ldeoxy[dichloroacetyi-1-`Qzhloramphenicol (Amersham), and 2.8 mglml acetyl coA (Sigma) in 100 nl of 0.25 M Tris (pH 7.7). Reactions were terminated by extraction with 1 ml of cold ethyl acetate. Acetylated products were separated by thin-layer chromatography and quantitated by scintillation counting. Plasmid Rescue, Subcloning, and Sequencing Episomai piasmids were rescued by alkaline iysis and transformed into E. coii DH5a. An Xbai fragment with the cDNA insert and part of the polylinker region of pEBS7 (Peterson and Legerski. 1991) was subcloned from pCSA5 into a kanamycin-resistant derivative of pUC, pBGS19 (Spratf et al., 1986) for sequence analysis. The cDNA insert was sequenced on both strands with Sequenase version 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corporation). RNA isolation and cDNA Synthesis Poiy(A)+ RNA was extracted from ceils with a Fast Track Kit (lnvitrogen). First-strand cDNAs were prepared from 0.5 pg of poly(A) RNA by priming with oiigo(dT) as described (Peterson and Legerski, 1991). After first-strand synthesis, cDNAs were recovered by phenolchloroform extraction, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 50 ml of TE. PCR Ampilfication and Sequencing First-strand cDNA (10 ~1) was used for PCR amplification by Taq poiymerase (Promega) in buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Final MgCL concentration in the reaction was 1.5 mM. Amplification was performed for 30 consecutive cycles of 94OC for 15 s, 52°C for 30 s, and 72OC for 2.0 min. Two pairs of primers (Ml-M2 and M3-M4) that divided the CSA coding region into two overlapping segments were used. The sequences of the primers and their positions relative to the A residue of the ATG initiation codon, starting with the upstream pair, were as follows. Ml, 5"GCCGGTGTGAGGACACGATA-3', -19 to +l; M2, 5'AGCACl-TGCTGl-TGCCAAGA-3', 621-602; M3,5'-CTCACATTCTACAGGGTCACJ', 536-555; M4, 5'~AAAGTTTCAGCAGAGACAAA-3'9 1230-l 211. PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced by the dideoxy method on an Applied Biosystems Model 373A automated sequencer. Piasmid Constructs for in Vitro Transcription Plasmid constructs were generated for in vitro expression of TFIIH components either with or without the 9ElO epitope tag by using the vector pGEM4Z-SE10 as described (Bardwell et al., 1994). This vector contains a sequence encoding 10 amino acids representing the 9ElO epitope of c-Myc protein, followed by the poiyiinker in the SP6 orientation. Cloning in-frame in these sites followed by in vitro transcription from the SP6 promoter generated mRNA that was translated to yield 9ElO epitope-tagged fusion proteins. Cloning in the opposite orientation resulted in constructs that produced nontagged mRNA following transcription from the T7 promoter. Constructs were verified by restriction mapping. The CSA gene was cloned into vectors for in vitro transcription by  Ceil Lines, Transfections, and UV Selection The SV4Otransformed CS-A fibroblast line CSSBE.S3.Gl was provided by L. V. M. (Brumback et al., 1976; Mayne et al., 1966). The EBV-transformed iymphobiast line GM2964 is from an atypical case of CS with late onset of clinical symptoms and unusually prolonged survival; it was obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Kennedy et al., 1980; Otsuka et al., 1984). The CS-A fibrobiast cell lines CS5BR and CSGBR were identified and characterized by A. R. L. and M. S., and the SV40-transformed CS-B cell line CSIAN.S3.G2 was isolated by L. V. M. (Mayne et al., 1966). The normal EBV-transformed iymphoblast line GM1953 was from the Human Genetic Mutant Ceil Repository; HT1060 (CCLIPI) and CCD-42Sk (CRL1513) were from the American Type Culture Collection; and the XP-C ceil line XP4PA-SV was provided by Dr. A. Sarasin. Fibrobiast lines were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with lo%-20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2x nonessential amino acids, 2 mM L-giutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 pg/ml amphotericin B (GIBCO). Lymphobiast lines were maintained in RPM1 1640 media supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-giutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 U/ml streptomycin sulfate (GIBCO). Selection for integration of pSV2neo was with 250 pg/ml G416 (GIBCO), and selection for episomai vectors carrying the hph gene was with 177 UI ml hygromycin B (Caibiochem). The SV48transformed fibrobiast lines CS3BE.S3.Gl, CSlANS3.G2, and XP4PA-SV were cotransfected with piasmids pSV2neo (Southern and Berg, 1962) and pCMVEBNA (Swirski et al., 1992) by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. Cional lines showing increased stable transfection with piasmid pDR2 (Murphy et al., 1992) were designated CSAIENlP, CSB/EN7, and XPCIENIZ, respectively. Transfection with episomai piasmids was by eiectroporation. To screen for compiementation of CS-A ceils with a human cDNA library in an EBV-based vector, 5 x lO"CSAIEN12 ceils/ml in serumfree MEM at room temperature were electroporated at 750 V/cm with 50 pg of the cDNA library and 350 ng of sonicated herring testes DNA as carrier, at a capacitance of 800 pF. After a 10 min recovery period, cells were plated with 10 ml of growth media containing 250 nglml G418. After electroporation (48 hr later), plates were fed with 10 ml of growth media containing 177 U/ml hygromycin B to select for the presence of the cDNA library and were refed with hygromycin-containing medium every 2 days. Approximately 4000 hygromycin-resistant colonies were obtained per eiectroporation. On days 6, 10, and 14, plates were irradiated with 4 J/m2 UV radiation at a dose rate of 1 J/m*/s to select for cDNAs that complemented the UV sensitivity of CS cells. After eiectroporation (18-21 days), surviving colonies were picked, expanded, and tested for resistance to UV light by irradiating one of two 60 mm dishes at 4 J/m2. UV Radiation Survival Survival of fibroblast lines was quantitated by colony-forming ability. Dilutions were plated in triplicate and allowed to attach for 6-16 hr. Medium was removed, and the plates were irradiated at a dose rate  Cockayne 563  Syndrome  Group  A Gene  PCR with the following primers: 5'-TGGAATTCATGCTGGGGTTIlTGTCCGC3'(CSAforward) and 5"TTGGAATTCTATTCATCCTTCTTCATCACT-3' (CSA reverse). EcoRl restriction sites for cloning inframe are underlined. Synthesis of nontagged CSA mRNA was from the T7 promoter. To transcribe the full-length CSA gene, the construct was linearized at the 3' end beyond the termination codon. Digestion of the template using Sspl and Ndel generated runoff transcripts that were translated in vitro to yield polypeptides with C-terminal deletions CSA(l-187) and CSA(l-146) respectively. In Vitro Transcription and Translation In vitro transcription with the Ambion SP6 or T7 mMessage mMachine kit and purification of mRNA were as described (Bardwell et al., 1994). In vitro translation of purified mRNA using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Novagen) was carried out in the presence of [-Sjmethionine (Amersham) at 30°C. Translation of epitope-tagged mRNA and control translations were performed under identical conditions, except that the reactions did not contain labeled methionine. All translation products were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation as described (Bardwell et al., 1994) and used for immunoprecipitation. lmmunoprecipitation lmmunoprecipitation reactions were carried out in buffer A consisting of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5) 75 mM KCI, 5 mM sodium bisulfite, 4 mM MgCb, 0.5 mfvt EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 12.5% glycerol, and the protease inhibitors pepstatin (1 uglml), leupeptin (1 @ml), and PMSF (1 mM). lmmunoprecipitation was carried out as described (Bardwell et al., 1994). Partially purified in vitro translated proteins were resuspended in buffer A at 3 x translation volume. Aliquots (60 ul) of each of the two interacting proteins were mixed with 60 pl of buffer A and incubated at 30°C for 30 min. Reactions were incubated in the presence of 9ElO antibody-protein A-agarose complexes for 1 hr at room temperature on a rocking platform. Protein complexes were pelleted and washed at least three times with buffer A. Following resuspension and heat denaturation to disrupt complexes, radioactivity in aliquots was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Samples were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE using equal volumes of test and control reactions on 10% or 15% gels, followed by fluorography. Protein-protein interactions were evaluated by comparing the amount of radioactivity immunoprecipitated by antibody in the presence of epitope-tagged protein with that precipitated nonspecifically in the absence of epitope-tagged protein. Radioactivity at least 3-fold above background was considered positive after multiple independent experiments Protein-Protein Interactions In Vivo Interaction of CSA and CSB proteins in vivo was evaluated with the yeast two-hybrid system as described (Bardwell et al., 1993). The CSA gene was amplified by PCR from pGEM42-CSA by using primer 4216 (5"GGCCATGGGCATGCTGGGGGTlTlTGTCCGC-3') containing an Ncol site (underlined) and primer 4217 (5'-TTGGTCGACTATTCATCCTTCTTCATCACTSr) containing a Sal1 site (underlined). The amplified product was digested with Ncol and Sall and cloned into plasmid pAS1 (Durfeeet al., 1993). TheCSBgene wasamplified by PCRfrom plasmid pGEM42-CSB by using primer 5091 (5'CTCGGGATCCGTATGC CAAATGAGGGAATCCCCCAC-37 containing a BamHl site (underlined) and primer 2388(5'-AAGGGATCCTGTTTAGCAGTATTCTGGCTTGAGTTT-3) containing a BamHl site (underlined). The amplified product was digested with BamHl and cloned into PACT (Durfee et al., 1993). Chromosome Mapping PCR amplifications were performed in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermal cycler using AmpliTaq polymerase and the conditions recommended by the supplier (Cetus). Sequences for primers were 5'-GAGCAGCAGTGATGAAGAAGG-3' (forward) and S'-AGGCAGGAllTGGTCATACC-3' (reverse). Resulting PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels. Standard methods were employed for the isolation of genomic and plasmid DNA. Southern blot hybridization used EcoRIand HinDIll-digested genomic DNA blotted onto Zeta-Probe Genomic Tested membrane according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Bio-Rad).

RIVERO-LEZCANO, ANTONIO MARCILLA, JEANNE H. SAMESHIMA, AND KEITH C. ROBBINS* Laboratory of Cellular Development and Oncology, National Institute of Dental Research, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4330 Received 19 April 1995/Returned for modification 28 May 1995/Accepted 27 July 1995  In the second of a series of experiments designed to identify p47nck-Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding molecules, we report the cloning of SAKAP II (Src A box Nck-associated protein II) from an HL60 cDNA expression library. This molecule has been identified as a cDNA encoding the protein product of WASP, which is mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients. Studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated a highly specific interaction between the SH3 domains of p47nck and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Furthermore, anti-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein antibodies recognized a protein of 66 kDa by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. In vitro translation studies identified the 66-kDa protein as the protein product of WASP, and subcellular fractionation experiments showed that p66WASP is mainly present in the cytosol fraction, although significant amounts are also present in membrane and nuclear fractions. The main p47nck region implicated in the association with p66WASP was found to be the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain. Signal transduction pathways that connect the cell surface with the nucleus utilize protein-protein interactions. Two of the most studied elements that participate in the recognition of specific protein targets are the Src homology 2 (SH2) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, first described as noncatalytic components of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (36). SH2 domains associate with proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine residues within a specific amino acid sequence motif (4, 44). In contrast, SH3 domains recognize proline-rich segments (8) without any requirements for protein modification, allowing for the constitutive association of this domain with its target proteins. No common functional features have been found among either the SH3-containing proteins or the SH3-binding proteins. For instance, the SH3 domains of the tyrosine kinases Lck, Fyn, and Abl associate with the p85 subunit of pI3 kinase (23); the adaptor molecule Grb2, which possesses two SH3 domains, links receptor tyrosine kinases to the SH3-binding protein Sos, a regulator of small G proteins (12); and the SH3 domain of the cytoskeletal protein alpha-spectrin binds to the epithelial sodium channel (41). Such heterogeneity makes it difficult to predict the putative ligands for each of the known SH3 domains. The nck gene was initially isolated from a human melanoma cDNA library, and its product is a 47-kDa cytosolic protein exclusively composed of one SH2 and three SH3 domains (30). This protein is ubiquitously expressed, and its function has not been defined. Although activated tyrosine kinase receptors (6, 31, 34, 35) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (29) have been shown to bind to the SH2 domain of p47nck, the proteins which associate with its SH3 domains are less well characterized. In vitro studies have shown variability in the association of Nck with the Abl protein-tyrosine kinase (17, 38) while no interaction with dynamin, another known SH3-binding protein, has * Corresponding author.

Recent studies have shown the association of Nck SH3 domains with two other proteins: Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras (21), previously described as binding to the SH3-containing protein Grb2 (12); and a serine/threonine kinase, designated NAK (7). Both molecules exhibit preferential binding to the second SH3 domain of Nck. In order to identify other proteins that specifically bind to p47nck, we expressed its three SH3 domains as a fusion protein to screen Raw 264.7 (a mouse macrophage-like cell line) and HL60 (a human promyelomonocytic cell line) cDNA expression libraries. The first clone characterized, SAKAP I, corresponded to the proto-oncogene c-cbl (40), the cellular homolog of v-cbl, originally isolated from Cas NS-1, a murine retrovirus that induces pre-B- and pro-B-cell lymphomas (28). The function of the protein product of its cellular counterpart, p120c-cbl, has not yet been determined, but it has been found to associate in vivo with p56lyn and p47nck (32, 40). Recent studies have implicated p120c-cbl in tyrosine kinase signaling pathways because it is phosphorylated in tumors induced by activated Abl tyrosine kinase (5). In the present study, we report the analysis of a second cDNA clone, SAKAP II, identified as encoding the protein product of the gene WASP. This gene was recently isolated by a positional cloning strategy and was found to be mutated in several Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients (11, 27). WAS is an X chromosome-linked recessive disorder which is associated with severe thrombocytopenia, eczema, impaired humoral and cellular immunity, and increased susceptibility to lymphoid malignancies (2, 45). Our findings begin to elucidate the molecular nature of WAS protein (WASP). MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture. Human promyelomonocytic HL60 cells (10) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To induce differentiation toward the monocytic lineage, exponentially growing cells were subcultured at a density of 105 cells per ml for 48 h in the presence of 50 nM 12-Otetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Sigma Chemical Co.). Monkey kidney COS-7 cells (18) were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Antibodies. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Fyn (FYN3), anti-Cbl (C-15), and anti-Sp1 (PEP 2) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; rabbit  5726  RIVERO-LEZCANO ET AL.  MOL. CELL. BIOL.  polyclonal anti-Lyn antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was purchased from ICN Biomedical; and goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Cappel. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Nck and anti-gluthatione S-transferase (GST) antibodies have been described elsewhere (40). Antibodies were raised in rabbits against a GST fusion protein containing the first 441 amino acids of WASP. Cloning and sequencing. Nck SH3-GST fusion protein was used to screen a lambdaZAP (Stratagene) cDNA library obtained from TPA-differentiated HL60 cells as described previously (40). Nucleotide sequencing of the isolated clones utilized dideoxy chain termination technology (Sequenase version 2.0; U.S. Biochemical Corp.). GenBank and EMBL data bases were screened with the BLAST program (3). Expression vector construction and transfection of COS-7 cells. pcDNA3 vector was purchased from Invitrogen. pcDNA3-fyn, a kind gift from Hidemi Teramoto, was constructed by cloning a 2.4-kilobase pair (kb) BamHI fragment derived from Zip-fyn (25). pcDNA3-WASP was constructed by cloning a 1.8-kb Asp 718-BamHI fragment derived from the original pBluescript-WASP clone. One microgram of each plasmid DNA was transfected into COS-7 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique, as modified by Wigler et al. (49). Preparation of GST fusion proteins. Fgr-SH3-GST and Fyn-SH3-GST fusion proteins have been described elsewhere (39). Phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma)-SH3GST, alpha-spectrin­SH3­GST, Eps 8-SH3-GST, the three SH3 domains of NckGST (3K), and full-length Nck (K) fusion proteins have been previously described (40). The DNA fragment encoding the amino-terminal SH3 domain of Nck (3KI, amino acids 4 to 98) was amplified by PCR from the nck cDNA and subcloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia) to facilitate expression as a GST fusion protein. The HindII-BstEII (Klenow end-filled) fragment of nck, containing the middle SH3 domain (3KII, amino acids 98 to 170), was ligated into blunt-ended EcoRI-cut pGEX-2T. The BstEII-StuI (Klenow end-filled) fragment of nck, containing the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain (3KIII, amino acids 170 to 270), was ligated into blunt-ended XmaI-cut pGEX-2T. Point mutations within the individual SH3 domains of Nck were generated in a two-step PCR procedure with two internal oligonucleotides encompassing the point mutation and two oligonucleotides upstream and downstream of the SH3 domains, as described by Ho et al. (20). Constructs were subcloned in pGEX-4T-3 (Pharmacia). In this way, fusion proteins were obtained with proline 243 (within the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain) changed to leucine in the three SH3 domains of Nck-GST (3K); prolines 52, 156, and 243 (one in each SH3 domain), changed to leucines in the three SH3 domains of Nck-GST (3K); and proline 243 changed to leucine in the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain-GST fusion protein (3KIII). The EcoRI fragment of WASP (amino acids 1 to 441) was ligated into EcoRI-cut pGEX-4T-3. All constructs were verified by sequencing through the entire portion obtained by PCR. Purification of GST fusion proteins has been described previously (39). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. Immunoprecipitation of proteins from HL60 cell lysates and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described (39). When denaturing conditions were necessary, cells were lysed by addition of boiling 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)­10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and boiled for an additional 5 min. After brief sonication and centrifugation, lysates were diluted 10-fold with regular lysis buffer without SDS (39) and used for immunoprecipitation. For antibody competition experiments, antibodies were incubated overnight with 2 mug of the corresponding GST fusion protein coupled to agarose beads and centrifuged and the supernatant was added to cell lysates for immunoprecipitation. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham), and exposed to HyperfilmECL (Amersham) as described previously (39). For reprobing, membranes were exhaustively washed with 100 mM glycine (pH 2.5), blocked with 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5)­150 mM NaCl­4% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and probed with a different primary antibody. In vitro transcription and translation. One microgram of DNA was transcribed from the T3 promoter present in pBluescript II (Stratagene), the vector used for the original cloning. Translation in vitro was accomplished in the presence of [35S]methionine with the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system from Promega. A total of 5 and 10 mul of the reaction mixture were diluted in 100 mul of lysis buffer and incubated with anti-WASP antibodies and Gammabind G-Sepharose (Pharmacia) or SH3-GST fusion proteins coupled to agarose beads (Sigma), respectively. After extensive washing of the beads, bound material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Subcellular fractionation. HL60 cells were lysed in a hypotonic buffer, and proteins were isolated as nuclear, cytosolic, and membrane fractions as described elsewhere (16). Each fraction was boiled in Laemmli buffer and analyzed for the presence of a variety of proteins by Western blot.  FIG. 1. Western blot analysis of anti-WASP immunoprecipitates. (A) A total of 2 mug of GST-WASP fusion protein (lane 1) and 3 mg of protein from HL60 cell lysates (lanes 2 through 5) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-WASP antibody (alphaWASP, lanes 1 through 4) or preimmune serum (Pre, lane 5), fractionated by SDS­10% PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. A total of 20 mug of protein from total cell lysates (TCL) was identically analyzed (lanes 6 and 7). For competition experiments, anti-WASP antibody was incubated in the presence of GST-WASP fusion protein (G-W, lanes 1 and 2) or GST protein (G, lane 3) as described in Materials and Methods. Membranes were incubated for Western blot (WB) with anti-WASP antibody (alphaWASP, lanes 1 through 6) or antiWASP preimmune serum (Pre, lane 7). The positions of p66 and the heavy and light chains of the antibody (HC and LC, respectively) are indicated. (B) COS-7 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3 vector (vec, lane 1) or pcDNA3WASP (WASP, lane 2) and lysed after 64 h. Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-WASP (alphaWASP) antibody, fractionated by SDS­10% PAGE, and Western blotted with anti-WASP antibody as a probe. The position of p66 is indicated.

In a previous study, we reported the cloning of SAKAP I from a Raw 264.7 cDNA library with the three SH3 domains of Nck-GST  fusion protein as a probe. Detection of positive plaques was accomplished by means of anti-GST antibodies and 125I-labeled protein A (40). The same procedure was followed to screen a cDNA library from TPA-differentiated HL60 cells. Four positive plaques were obtained after screening 106 recombinant phage. Sequencing and restriction mapping analysis confirmed that all four isolates represented a unique clone of 1.8 kb. A GenBank search revealed homology with WASP, a recently isolated gene (11). The 5' end of our clone corresponded to nucleotide 19 of the published sequence, and no stop codons were present between this nucleotide and the initiation codon at nucleotides 34 to 36. The sequence of our gene differed from the reported sequence (11) but perfectly corresponded with that obtained by Kwan et al. (27). Anti-WASP antibody recognizes a protein of 66 kDa. In order to characterize the protein encoded by our WASP clone, we raised a polyclonal antibody against the first 441 amino acids expressed as a GST fusion protein. After immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, this antibody was found to recognize a protein of 66 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 4), which was not immunoprecipitated by the preimmune serum (lane 5). A protein of the same size can be detected in a total cell lysate probed with anti-WASP antibody (lane 6) but not with preimmune serum (lane 7). To test the specificity of the antibody, we incubated anti-WASP in the presence of GST and GST-WASP fusion protein. In these conditions, GST-WASP (lane 2), but not GST (lane 3), was able to block the capacity of the antibody to recognize p66. The 82-kDa band observed in lane 2 is a bacterial contaminating protein, because it was also detected in an immunoprecipitation in the presence of GST-WASP fusion protein but in the absence of HL60 cell lysate (lane 1). Anti-WASP antibody also detected two bands of approximately 150 kDa in lane 4, but not in lane 3. To analyze WASP, we expressed the original WASP clone in COS-7 cells. Only one extra band was observed in cells transfected with WASP (Fig. 1B, lane 2) compared with COS-7 cells  VOL. 15, 1995  WASP PHYSICALLY ASSOCIATES WITH Nck  5727  FIG. 2.

Molecular mass markers are indicated in kilodaltons.  FIG. 3. In vitro binding of p66WASP to GST-SH3 fusion proteins. 35S-labeled p66WASP was synthesized by coupled transcription/translation reactions as described in Materials and Methods, and 10 mul of the reaction mixture was incubated in the presence of 5 mug of various GST-SH3 fusion proteins. Bound proteins were fractionated by SDS­10% PAGE, dried, and exposed to X-Omat AR film. (A) 35S-labeled p66WASP was incubated in the presence of GST (GS), the three Nck SH3 domains-GST (3K), the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain of Nck-GST (3K III), the middle Nck SH3-GST (3K II), and the amino-terminal Nck SH3-GST (3K I) fusion proteins. The position of p66WASP is indicated. (B) 35 S-labeled p66WASP was incubated in the presence of GST (GS), the three Nck SH3 domains-GST (3K), Eps 8 SH3-GST (Ep), alpha-spectrin SH3-GST (Sp), PLCgamma 1 SH3-GST (PL), Fgr SH3-GST (Fg), and Fyn SH3-GST (Fy) fusion proteins. The position of p66WASP is indicated. (C) 35S-labeled p66WASP was incubated in the presence of GST (lane 1), the carboxy-terminal Nck SH3-GST (lane 2), the carboxy-terminal Nck SH3-GST with proline 243 changed to leucine (lane 3), the three Nck SH3 domains-GST (lane 4), the three Nck SH3 domains-GST with proline 243 (within the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain) changed to leucine (lane 5), the three Nck SH3 domains-GST with prolines 52, 156, and 243 (one in each SH3 domain) changed to leucine (lane 6), and full-length Nck-GST (lane 7) fusion proteins. The position of p66WASP is indicated. Molecular mass markers are indicated in kilodaltons.  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  expressing the vector alone (pcDNA3, lane 1). The molecular mass of this band was 66 kDa, accurately matching the size of p66. Proteins of 87 and 150 kDa observed in this experiment were not reproducible (see Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that these bands are nonspecific. These results provided strong evidence that p66 is encoded by WASP. The relationship between the other proteins scored in Western blot analysis and the WASP gene remains unclear. WASP is translated in vitro as p66. The expression of a 66-kDa protein in COS-7 cells showed that p66 was a protein product of WASP. This size markedly differed from the predicted molecular mass deduced from the cDNA sequence (53 kDa). This difference might be a consequence of posttranslational modifications in HL60 or COS-7 cells. To address this possibility, we performed in vitro translation experiments with the T3 RNA promoter present in the original cloning vector by using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, in which four 35Slabeled proteins could be observed (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The major band migrated as a 66-kDa protein, the size of the most prominent band detected in anti-WASP immunoprecipitates from HL60 cells and from WASP-transfected COS-7 cells. Two other bands of 29 and 34 kDa were also observed when translated RNA from pBluescript vector was analyzed (lane 1), indicating that they are not WASP translational products. Finally, a band of 30 kDa detected only as a WASP translational product (lane 2) might be a degradation product of WASP or the result of the incomplete translation of a WASP mRNA. In order to confirm that in vitro-translated p66 could associate with Nck, thus reproducing the result obtained in the cloning of SAKAP II, we incubated 10 mul of the translation reaction mixture with 5 mug of a GST fusion protein containing full-length Nck. p66 associated with GST-Nck (Fig. 2B, lane 2) but not with GST alone (lane 1). Moreover, p66 was detected  in anti-WASP immunoprecipitates from 5 mul of the translation reaction mixture (lane 4) but not when a nonreactive serum was used for immunoprecipitation (lane 3). This result confirms the reactivity of the anti-GST-WASP antiserum with p66. On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that p66 is the primary translational product of the WASP cDNA and that the discrepancy with the theoretical size of the WASP gene product might be ascribed to abnormalities in its gel migration or to putative posttranslational modifications that also occur in reticulocyte lysate. In vitro association of p66WASP with a variety of SH3 domains. To characterize the association of p66WASP with p47nck, we expressed the three SH3 domains together (3K), and each of the SH3 domains of p47nck independently (3KI, 3KII, and 3KIII), as GST fusion proteins. 35S-labeled p66WASP from in vitro translation reaction mixtures was incubated in the presence of beads coupled to each of the described fusion proteins and analyzed by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3A, the three SH3 domains of Nck together (3K) and the third SH3 domain (3KIII, closest to the carboxyl terminus) were able to bind p66WASP. In contrast, neither GST nor the other two SH3 domains (3KI and 3KII) appreciably associated with p66WASP. The higher intensity of the signal associated with the three SH3 domains together (3K) compared with that observed in the third SH3 domain alone (3KIII) suggests that although the first (3KI) and second (3KII) SH3 domains do not independently associate with p66WASP, they might cooperate with the third SH3 domain (3KIII) to enhance binding. We next tested the specificity of SH3 binding to p66WASP by utilizing SH3 domains of a diverse group of proteins including the protein-tyrosine kinases Fyn (25) and Fgr (24), pLCgamma 1 (46), the cytoskeletal protein alpha-spectrin (48), and a substrate of  5728  RIVERO-LEZCANO ET AL.  MOL. CELL. BIOL.  the epidermal growth factor receptor Eps 8 (15). With the exception of the SH3 element of p59fyn and p55fgr, none of the SH3 domains tested associated with p66WASP (Fig. 3B). The affinity for Fyn-SH3 appeared to be greater than that observed for Fgr-SH3 and Nck-SH3 (3K). These results demonstrate a selective interaction between p66 and the SH3 domains from Nck and members of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases Fgr and Fyn. To analyze the nature of p66WASP-p47nck interaction, we constructed mutated versions of the SH3 domains of Nck. Close to the carboxy terminus of SH3 domains, there is a well-conserved proline which was changed to leucine in a version of sem-5 (9), a mutation that severely affected the function of the protein. This same mutation impairs the capability of the SH3 domain of both Grb2 and Src to associate with their specific targets (12, 13). As previously shown in Fig. 3A, the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain of Nck (3KIII) associated with p66WASP (Fig. 3C, lane 2), but when proline 243 (equivalent to the one mutated in sem-5) was changed to leucine, the association was completely abrogated (lane 3). When this same residue was changed to leucine in the context of the three SH3 domains of Nck (3K, lane 5), the association with p66WASP was greatly affected, but not completely blocked, compared with wild-type domains (lane 4). The inhibition of the interaction was complete when prolines 52, 156, and 243 (one in each of the SH3 domains) were changed to leucines (lane 6). As previously shown in Fig. 2B, full-length Nck (K) associated with p66WASP, but to a lesser extent than the three SH3 domains without the SH2 (3K, Fig. 3C, lane 7), suggesting that the SH2 domain diminishes but does not block the association. These results demonstrate that the p66WASP-p47nck interaction is mediated by the SH3 domains of p47nck. In vivo association of p66WASP with p47nck. To gain further insight regarding the functional importance of the p47nckp66WASP association, we asked whether they interacted in vivo. Thus, lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with WASP were immunoprecipitated with anti-Nck (p47nck is constitutively expressed in COS-7 cells) and examined by Western blotting with anti-WASP antibodies as a probe. p66WASP could be readily observed in anti-Nck immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A, lane 3), but not in cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector alone (lane 1). However, in reciprocal experiments, p47nck could not be detected in anti-WASP immunoprecipitates (lane 5). As the SH3 domain of p59fyn was also observed to bind p66WASP in vitro (Fig. 3B), we tested whether this binding also occurs in vivo. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with both WASP and fyn, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiFyn or anti-WASP antibodies (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 through 12). Although p59fyn is naturally expressed at low levels in these cells (Fig. 4A, lane 10), its expression was increased severalfold upon transfection with the fyn construct (lane 11). When lysates from cotransfected cells were examined for binding, p59fyn was not detected in anti-WASP immunoprecipitates (lane 12), and reciprocally, p66WASP was not detected in antip59fyn immunoprecipitates (lane 9). These results suggest that the direct binding of these molecules observed in vitro might not reflect in vivo association. To determine whether p66WASP and p47nck might associate in vivo in naturally occurring cells, lysates from HL60 cells, in which both proteins are constitutively expressed, were examined. As expected, both p66WASP and p47nck were detected in HL60 lysates (Fig. 4B, lane 3). When we investigated anti-Nck immunoprecipitates for the presence of p66WASP, the protein was readily detected (lane 1). However, no p47nck was detectable in anti-WASP immunoprecipitates (lane 4), reproducing the result obtained in WASP-transfected COS-7 cells.

Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS­10% PAGE and Western blotted (WB) with either anti-WASP (lanes 1 through 3 and 7 through 9) or anti-Fyn (lanes 10 through 12) antibodies as probes. Lanes 1 through 3 were stripped and reblotted with anti-Nck antibodies (lanes 4 through 6). The positions of p66WASP, p47nck, and p59fyn are indicated. (B) A total of 3 mg of protein from HL60 cells was immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Nck (alphaNck, lane 1), preimmune serum (Pre, lane 2), or anti-WASP (alphaWASP, lane 4) antibodies. A total of 40 mug of total cell lysate (TCL, lane 3) as well as immunoprecipitates was fractionated by SDS­10% PAGE and Western blotted (WB) with anti-WASP antibodies (alphaWASP, upper panel). The membrane was then stripped and reblotted with anti-Nck antibodies (alphaNck, lower panel). The positions of p66WASP and p47nck are indicated. Molecular mass markers are shown in kilodaltons.  of detectability of p47nck in anti-WASP immunoprecipitates could be explained by several possibilities, including the presence of p47nck, which might affect the recognition of p66WASP, or the stoichiometry and number of complexes recognized by each antibody. Thus, p66WASP was detected in association with p47nck in both HL60 cells and COS-7 cells transfected with WASP. The fact that we did not observe p47nck in anti-WASP immunoprecipitates prompted us to test whether p66WASP was directly detected by anti-Nck antibodies. This would explain the presence of p66WASP in anti-Nck immunoprecipitates. For this purpose, we immunoprecipitated cell lysates from transfected COS-7 cells obtained in either native or denaturing  VOL. 15, 1995  WASP PHYSICALLY ASSOCIATES WITH Nck  5729  FIG. 5. Western blot analysis of anti-WASP immunoprecipitates from cell lysates obtained in either native or denaturing conditions. COS-7 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3 vector (vec, lanes 1 and 2) or pcDNA3-WASP (WASP, lanes 3 through 6) and lysed after 64 h in either native (n, lanes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) or denaturing (d, lane 5) conditions, as described in Materials and Methods. Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-WASP (alphaW, lanes 1 and 3), anti-Nck (alphaN, lanes 2, 4 and 5), or anti-Nck preimmune serum (Pre, lane 6). Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS­10% PAGE and Western blotted (WB) with anti-WASP antibody (alphaWASP, upper panel).

Cells transfected with the vector alone (pcDNA3) did not express p66WASP (lane 1), but p47nck could be readily detected (lane 2). Transfection of cells with pcDNA3-WASP allowed the efficient expression of p66WASP (lane 3). Immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-Nck antibodies in native conditions contained significant amounts of p66WASP (lane 4), which could not be observed in denaturing conditions (lane 5). As an additional control, an immunoprecipitate with anti-Nck preimmune sera was included (lane 6). Shadows in lanes 1 and 3 blotted with anti-Nck corresponded to the heavy chain of anti-WASP antibodies. This result demonstrated that the presence of p66WASP in anti-Nck immunoprecipitates was due not to a direct recognition by anti-Nck antibody but to the existence of a complex between p47nck and p66WASP which was disrupted in denaturing conditions. The specificity of the p47nck-p66WASP interaction was further confirmed when p66WASP was not observed in immunoprecipitates from other SH2- and SH3-containing proteins expressed in HL60 cells, including p85 subunit from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (14), Crk (33), PLCgamma 1 (46), Lyn (50), Syk (47), and Shc (37) (data not shown). To investigate the possibility that p47nck might bring p66WASP to tyrosine kinases via its SH2 domain, we tested p66WASP for tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunoblots with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies did not detect phosphorylation of p66WASP in HL60 cells activated with a variety of ligands including granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulation factor, interleukin 4, cross-linking of the Fcgamma receptor with immunoglobulin G in untreated cells, and H2O2 in TPA-differentiated cells (data not shown). Thus, p66WASP does not appear to be a substrate for protein tyrosine kinases. Localization of WASP in HL60 cells. A nuclear localization signal has been identified in the WASP sequence (11) between amino acids 222 and 235. To determine whether this molecule localizes to the nucleus, HL60 cells were fractionated into nuclear, cytosolic, and membrane fractions, as described in Materials and Methods. The purity of individual fractions was analyzed for specific markers by Western blotting. The transcription factor Sp1 (22) was used as a marker for the nuclear fraction; the Cbl protein (5) was used for the cytosolic fraction;  FIG. 6. Subcellular localization of p66WASP. Subcellular fractions from HL60 cells were prepared as described in Materials and Methods. N, nuclear fraction; C, cytosolic fraction; M, membrane fraction. Equal quantities of protein (40 mug) for each fraction or the total cellular lysate (T, lane 1) were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-p95-106sp1 (Sp1), anti-p120c-cbl (Cbl), anti-p53-56lyn (Lyn), or anti-p66WASP (WASP) antibodies (A) and anti-p47nck antibody (B). The positions of p66WASP and p47nck are indicated.  and, for the membrane fraction, Lyn (50), a myristylated protein attached to the cytoplasmic membrane, was used. Each of the proteins was present exclusively in the expected fraction, with the exception of Sp1, which was also present in minor quantities (less than 10% of the total Sp1 protein) in the cytosolic and membrane fractions. p66WASP was detected in nuclear, cytosolic, and membrane fractions (Fig. 6A, lanes 2, 3, and 4) but unequally distributed among these compartments. An estimation of the amount of p66WASP in each fraction was obtained by densitometry scanning of Western blots, and the signal intensity expressed with respect to the amount of marker protein present in each fraction was compared with that from a total lysate. Thus, the nuclear fraction was calculated to be enriched 10.4-fold, the cytoplasmic fraction was calculated to be enriched 1.8-fold, and the membrane fraction was calculated to be enriched 5.9fold. In this way, it was estimated that approximately 81% of p66WASP was cytoplasmic, while 16% was present in the membrane fraction and less than 3% was nuclear. Our findings demonstrate that p66WASP is predominantly cytoplasmic, and in light of the purity of our nuclear fraction, we also conclude that a subpopulation of p66WASP is nuclear. Three other bands of 53, 60, and 68 kDa, which reacted with anti-WASP antiserum, were observed in the enriched fractions. The 53- and 68-kDa proteins were present only in the cytosolic fraction, while the 60-kDa protein was detected exclusively in the nuclear fraction. At this point, the identities of these proteins and their relationships with p66WASP, other than at an immunologic level, are unknown. To further explore the conditions of p47nck-p66WASP interaction, we analyzed the localization of p47nck. Nck has been initially described as a cytoplasmic protein (30), and this seemed to be the case in HL60 cells (Fig. 6B). However, a small portion of p47nck (approximately 4% of the total  5730  RIVERO-LEZCANO ET AL.  MOL. CELL. BIOL.  amount) could be readily detected in the membrane fraction. Thus, both p66WASP and p47nck colocalize in the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions, although no trace of p47nck was observed in the nuclear fraction. DISCUSSION Very little is known about the signaling pathways in which p47nck participates. As an approach toward understanding its function, we have characterized proteins which associate with its SH3 domains. Previously, we described the association of p120c-cbl (SAKAP I) with p47nck in vivo (40). In the present study, we have characterized WASP, a new protein found to associate specifically with the SH3 domains of p47nck. The gene which encodes this protein (WASP) was also identified in mutant forms in patients with WAS (11, 27). The predicted amino acid sequence of WASP reveals its proline-rich nature. By virtue of the WASP proline-rich regions, Derry et al. (11) suggested that this protein might associate with SH3-containing proteins. This hypothesis has now been confirmed with the cloning of WASP with a p47nck-SH3GST fusion protein as a probe. Antibodies raised against WASP detected a major protein of 66 kDa. Evidence that p66 is the protein product of the WASP gene derives from transient transfection experiments in which WASP cDNA directed the synthesis of a 66-kDa protein, detectable with anti-WASP serum in COS-7 cells. Confirmation that p66 is the primary translational product was obtained when the original clone encoding the full-length WASP cDNA was transcribed and translated in vitro, in a cell-free system. The molecular mass of the product was 66 kDa, and it was also recognized by antiWASP antibodies. This protein, designated p66WASP, has an apparent molecular mass 13 kDa greater than that calculated from the DNA sequence (53 kDa). The anomalous migration in SDS-PAGE may result from its high proline content (18% of the total amino acids). In fact, anomalous gel electrophoretic mobility has been described for other proteins containing an unusually high number of proline residues (1). The origin of the other proteins detected by anti-WASP antibodies is still in question. These proteins do not associate with p47nck and might simply represent cross-reacting species, related or unrelated to p66WASP. As the probe used for the cloning of SAKAP II (WASP) included the three SH3 domains of Nck, but not the SH2 domain, it was likely that the association with p66WASP was SH3 mediated. We confirmed this hypothesis when mutants of the SH3 domains, impaired in their ability to associate with SH3-binding proteins, were unable to bind to p66WASP in vitro. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that the carboxyterminal SH3 domain seems to play a more important role in the interaction. However, this domain alone is not completely responsible for the association because the p66WASP binding in vitro was much higher when the three SH3 domains were used together than when only the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain was present. Additionally, the three SH3 domains-GST fusion protein, with the carboxy-terminal SH3 mutated, retained a residual, but significant, binding capacity. This result demonstrated that at least one domain, and possibly both of the other SH3 domains, is required for the interaction. The influence of the SH2 domain in the association appeared to be negative, as was also observed for the interaction p47nck-p120c-cbl (40). The abundance of proline in WASP makes this protein a likely candidate for association with SH3 domains of other molecules. Yet, specificity for this interaction was demonstrated when the SH3 domains from Fyn, Fgr, and Nck, but not from PLCgamma 1, alpha-spectrin, or Eps 8, associated in vitro with  p66WASP. This specificity was even stricter in vivo, because p59fyn and p66WASP did not associate in COS-7 transfected cells. Situations like this, in which in vitro associations have not been observed in vivo, have been reported for other cases, such as the association of C3G with Grb2, dynamin with pI3 kinase, and 3BP1 or 3BP2 with Abl (26). In addition, we did not detect p66WASP in anti-Crk, anti-p85 (pI3 kinase), anti-Lyn, or antiPLCgamma 1 immunoprecipitates from HL60 cells (data not shown). Although all of these proteins are well expressed in HL60 cells, the avidity of the immunoprecipitating antibodies might account for the lack of p66WASP detection. In any case, this result leaves p47nck as the only SH3-containing protein observed thus far to associate with p66WASP in vivo and strongly suggests that the interaction between p47nck and p66WASP is physiologically important. The finding that p66WASP associates with p47nck, an adaptor molecule, is consistent with previous reports of defective transmembrane signaling in cells from WAS patients (43). B cells from those patients failed to manifest the normal increased proliferation in response to anti-immunoglobulin treatment and displayed a defective mobilization of Ca2+. Other studies have observed that lymphocytes and platelets from WAS patients exhibited an aberrant O-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis (19), suggesting that this molecule may participate in the regulation of protein glycosylation. The degree of participation of WASP in signal transduction pathways is unclear. Initial experiments indicate that this molecule is not phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following cellular activation with a variety of ligands (data not shown). Simon et al. (43) previously showed that PLCgamma 1 was not phosphorylated after immunoglobulin ligation in B cells from WAS patients in contrast with normal cells. This observation may not be a consequence of impaired association between WASP and the SH3 domain of PLCgamma 1, because we were not able to score p66WASP in anti-PLCgamma 1 immunoprecipitates. The finding that a small portion of p66WASP is detectable in the nucleus of the HL60 cells raises interesting possibilities, including the transmission of signals from the membrane, where p47nck can associate with activated tyrosine kinase receptors, to the nucleus. Another p47nck-binding protein, p120ccbl, also contains a nuclear localization signal in its primary sequence, and its viral form (v-cbl) has also been detected in the nucleus (5), supporting the hypothesis of the role of p47nck in transmitting signals from membrane to nucleus. The formation of complexes between p66WASP and p47nck might be also favored because they colocalize in membrane and cytosol fractions. Evidence that the protein product of WASP is responsible for the clinical syndrome is not complete (10, 27). Nevertheless, our study is the first to describe the WASP, and the demonstration that p66WASP physically interacts with p47nck suggests that p66WASP may be normally involved in signal transduction in hematopoietic cells.

Despite their general use, little is known about the extent to which the degree of protein interaction determined by two-hybrid approaches parallels the degree of interaction determined by biochemical techniques. In this study, we used a set of lexAop-LEU2 and lexAop-lacZ reporters to calibrate the interaction trap. For the calibration, we used two sets of proteins, the Myc-Max-Mxi1 helix-loop-helix proteins, and wild-type and dimerization-defective versions of the lambda cI repressor. Our results indicate that the strength of interaction as predicted by the two-hybrid approach generally correlates with that determined in vitro, permitting discrimination of high-, intermediate-, and low-affinity interactions, but there was no single reporter for which the amount of gene expression linearly reflected affinity measured in vitro. However, some reporters showed thresholds and only responded to stronger interactions. Finally, some interactions were subject to directionality, and their apparent strength depended on the reporter used. Taken together, our results provide a cautionary framework for interpreting affinities from two-hybrid experiments. Biological systems depend on interactions between protein components. These interactions affect such diverse processes as the coordination of signal transduction by assembly of multisubunit complexes (57, 58), the regulation of apoptosis by the sequestration of Bax (54), and the control of gene expression through the selective association of transcription factors (19). Efforts to understand the functions of proteins often include identification and characterization of other cellular proteins with which they can interact. While some protein interactions are of high affinity and are easily detectable by physical techniques, a number of biologically important interactions, such as those of many enzymes with their substrates, are often relatively weak or transient and are not easily detectable by these methods. A number of approaches for studying protein association are in use, including cosedimentation through gradients, coimmunoprecipitation of purified proteins, assay of DNA binding activity for proteins that must dimerize to recognize a DNA site, and assay by two-hybrid systems (20) such as the interaction trap (31). In the last approach, a first protein (P1, or ``bait'') is fused to a known DNA-binding domain such as LexA (10) or GAL4 (41) and a second protein (P2) is fused to a transcriptional activation domain (AD). Coexpression of the two chimeric proteins in yeast cells in which the cognate binding site for the DNA-binding domain is located upstream of a reporter gene results in transcriptional activation of the reporter by the P2-fused AD if the chimeric proteins associate. Two-hybrid/interaction trap approaches have gained considerable popularity because they can detect novel interacting proteins that interact with a given bait by substituting an appropriate cDNA library for P2. A recent offshoot of these approaches, interaction mating, can be used to rapidly establish associations between large numbers of known proteins and * Corresponding author.

However, despite the frequent successes associated with the use of such systems, a systematic comparison of two-hybrid system-derived in vivo affinity determinations with in vitro determinations has not yet been undertaken. Such a comparison is critical in order to gauge the strength and significance of interactions observed in two-hybrid experiments. Here, we tested the extent to which data obtained from a two-hybrid system, the interaction trap, paralleled those obtained from in vitro assays. To this end, we studied associations between two groups of proteins whose oligomerizations have been estimated in vitro. As a first group, we utilized a set of functionally interrelated helix-loop-helix proteins (47): Myc (1), Max (8), and Mxi1 (60). Myc is overexpressed in a large number of cancers (1) and exerts its effects, at least in part, by associating with a second protein, Max, to form heterodimers that bind a CACGTG motif upstream of genes whose products may contribute to carcinogenesis and stimulating their transcription (2). Max associates with high affinity with Mxi1 (60) and Mad (4); these heterodimeric complexes bind the same CACGTG motif but repress transcription through the action of a ternary partner that coassociates with Mad and Mxi1, a mammalian homolog of the yeast SIN3 protein (5, 56). Approximation of the dimerization affinity of these proteins by cosedimentation through gradients (for Myc-Max and MycMyc) and by competitive binding to DNA containing the CACGTG motif (for all combinations) suggests that Myc and Max and Max and Mxi1 heterodimerize with similar high affinities (Kd, &amp;lt;5 nM) and are likely to form complexes at physiological concentrations in mammalian cells, while Myc-Myc and Max-Max homodimerize only at much higher protein concentrations (maximum Kd for dimerization, &amp;gt;1 muM) in an interaction probably not physiological for these proteins (4, 43, 60). As a second group, we utilized the bacteriophage lambda repressor protein cI (50) and a series of cI mutants (14, 26). The biological activity of lambda repressor protein cI depends on its ability to form homodimers (reviewed in reference 50).  VOL. 15, 1995  INTERACTION TRAP­TWO-HYBRID SYSTEM CALIBRATION  5821  Lambda is a temperate phage. During lysogenic growth, lambda expresses the cI protein, which dimerizes to bind and repress operators of genes required for lysis. Upon treatment with UV light or other DNA-damaging agents, cleavage by RecA separates the cI amino-terminal DNA-binding domain and carboxy-terminal dimerization domain. The resulting monomeric cI DNA-binding domains dissociate from the operators of lysis-specific phage genes, allowing their induction. The full-length wild-type cI protein (cI-WT) has been rigorously established to dimerize in solution with a Kd of 20 nM (55), while the mutants in our analysis set homodimerized with Kds ranging from 200 nM to greater than 1 muM (14, 26). We constructed a series of LexA-fused proteins (baits) and AD-fused proteins derived from Myc, Max, Mxi1, and cI. We assembled a series of LexA-responsive lacZ reporter genes that differed in their sensitivities to transcriptional activation because they contained different numbers of operators for LexA upstream of the lacZ transcription start, and we constructed a similar set of lexA-responsive LEU2 reporter strains. We then assayed activation of these reporters by combinations of baits and AD-fused proteins within each group. We found that the measured strength of a protein-protein interaction generally correlated with in vitro determinations of dimerization affinity, in that interactions determined in vitro to be of high, intermediate, or low affinity could be similarly discriminated in yeast strains. Moreover, some of the reporters showed thresholds of activation, such that weak interactions (Kd, &amp;gt;1 muM) were generally not detected. However, there was no single reporter gene for which the strength of interaction correlated linearly to affinities reported in vitro, suggesting that it is inappropriate to use differences in reporter transcription as a direct measure of interaction affinity. With the LEU2 reporter, differences in interaction affinity were reflected in plating efficiency on medium lacking leucine rather than a general decrease in growth rate, suggesting that expression of the LEU+ phenotype is also subject to a threshold. Finally, in some cases, affinity was affected by whether the fused moiety was attached to LexA or the AD, and in some cases, it appeared to be affected by higher-order oligomerization of the fused moiety. These studies provide a framework for investigators evaluating interaction affinity by using two-hybrid assays. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning and bacterial strains. Escherichia coli DH5alphaF' [F'/endA1 hsdR17(rK- mK+)supE44 thi-1 recA1 gyrA (Nalr) relA1 Delta(lacZYA-argF)U169 (80lacDelta(lacZ) M15)] was used as a host for all plasmid constructions. DNA was manipulated by standard methods (3, 52). Construction of EGY strains. lexAop-LEU2 reporter strains were made as follows. A HindIII cassette containing the URA3 gene was inserted into the plasmid pHR33 (a gift of R. Rothstein) to create the yeast integrating plasmid pXLEU2, which contained the 5' end of the LEU2 coding region, a unique BglII site located upstream of the LEU2 minimal promoter, and Ty element sequences further upstream. The BglII cloning site is located 220 bp upstream of the LEU2 transcription start site. One, two, or three copies of a BamHI-ended doublestranded 42-mer that contained the overlapping double lexA operator found upstream of the colicin E1 gene (18, 36), with the plus-strand sequence 5'GATC CTGCTGTATATAAAACCAGTGGTTATATGTACAGTACG3', were inserted into the BglI site to generate plasmids p1LexLEU2, p2LexLEU2, and p3LexLEU2. These were linearized by digestion with ClaI and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae U457 (MATa SUP53-a ade2-1 can1-100 ura3-1 trp1-1 [phi+]), also a gift of R. Rothstein, and URA+ colonies were selected. The starting chromosomal array of genes in U457 is Ty1 element-SUP53-LEU2: the SUP53-a allele suppresses the trp1-1 gene, so U457 is TRP+ for growth. ura3 mutant revertants were selected by their ability to form colonies on medium that contained 5-fluoroorotic acid. ura3 trp1 leu2 yeast mutants were identified: these presumably resulted from recombination events that resolve the integrated plasmid by crossover between Ty1 sequences present on pXLEU variants and the chromosomal Ty1 element, resulting in loss of the SUP53-a gene and substitution of lexA operator sequences for the LEU2 UAS. Strains containing one (EGY18), two (EGY23), or three (EGY38) colEI operators upstream of the single chromo somal  LEU2 gene were isolated. These strains were made his3- by being mated to the strain GG100-14D (MATalpha his3 trp1 pho5) (32), with selection for LEU+ HIS+ diploids, sporulation, and selection for random spore products that were leu2, ura3, trp1, his3, and GAL+. EGY48, EGY195, and EGY191 are derivatives of EGY38, EGY22, and EGY18, respectively. lacZ reporter plasmids. lexAop-lacZ reporters have been previously described. The backbone for all reporters is pLR1del1 (59): oligonucleotides encoding lexA operators are inserted at a unique XhoI site -167 from the transcription start of GAL1-lacZ. p1840 contains a single lexA operator derived from the recA promoter and binds two lexA monomers (12). pJK103 (35) has a single high-affinity overlapping colE1 operator (which presumably binds two LexA dimers) (18) made by insertion of an oligonucleotide similar to that shown above but with XhoI ends. pSH18-34 (a gift of Steve Hanes) contains two tandem insertions of a double-stranded 78-bp oligonucleotide encoding two colE1 operators (plusstrand sequence, 5'-TCGACTGCTGTATATAAAACCAGTGGTTATATGTA CAGTACTGCTGTATATAAAACCAGTGGTTATATGTACAGTACG-3'), resulting in four colE1 (overlapping) operators upstream of the GAL1-lacZ gene (29). LexA fusion plasmids. pEG202 (29, 31) or its parent plasmid, pLexA202+PL (51), was used as an expression vector for constructing LexA-fused proteins. pLexA-HEF1 expresses LexA fused to a novel 185-amino-acid open reading frame isolated from an ongoing genetic screen for regulators of cell morphology (42). pLexA-RPB7 expresses LexA fused to the full-length coding sequence of the S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase II subunit RPB7 (45). pLexA-Myc and pLexA-Max have been described previously (60). pLexA-Myc expresses the carboxy-terminal 176 amino acids of human c-Myc, encompassing the complete helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domain but lacking the Nterminal acidic domain (37). pLexA-Max encodes the full-length (151-aminoacid) Max protein (8). Plasmids that carried cI-WT (49) and the E233K and the P158T (14, 26) mutants were obtained from A. Hochschild, and a clone for the A152T (26) mutant was obtained from J. Hu. PCR was used to prepare fragments of cI-WT and mutants corresponding to papain fragment c (amino acid residues 132 to 236) (48) that contained 5' EcoRI sites and 3' XhoI sites. These fragments were treated with Klenow fragment and cloned into the SmaI site of pUC119, and inserts in the resulting plasmids were completely sequenced. cI-WT, E233K, and P158T were reexcised with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into similarly cut pEG202: the final construct proceeded from LexA through the amino acid linker sequence EFAS to the TTKKAS. . . of the cI sequence. Sequencing of A152T revealed a single point mutation deleting a C at position 401 of the DNA sequence (amino acid 133). To correct for this, the A152T clone was excised as were the other cI clones with EcoRI and XhoI but was introduced into pEG202ATT, a derivative of pEG202 with the EcoRI site in an altered reading frame (27). For this clone, the final amino acid sequence would be LexA, the linker sequence NLGIRKHN, and then KKAS. . . of the cI mutant, with the substitution of HN for the TT of the original cI sequence. AD fusion plasmids. pJG4-5 (29, 31) or an altered reading frame derivative, pJG4-5ATT (27), was used as the expression vector for all AD fusions. This plasmid expresses proteins under control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter as fusions to a nuclear localization sequence, the hemagglutinin epitope tag, and the B42 AD as previously described. p4-5/Myc and p4-5/Max contain the same fragments of Myc and Max as the LexA fusions described above. p4-5/Mxi1 has been previously described and contains amino acids 46 to 228 of Mxi1 (60), commencing with KPPRR (residues 10 to 220 in reference 60); this corresponds approximately to the mMxi1-WR clone and lacks sequences required for interaction with SIN3 (56). EcoRI-XhoI fragments containing cI-WT, P158T, E233K, and A152T from the pUC119 clones described above were cloned into either pJG4-5 (cI-WT, P158T, E233K) or pJG4-5ATT (A152T). Interaction trap. EGY48, EGY195, and EGY191 yeast cells were transformed by standard methods (34) with plasmids expressing LexA fusions, AD fusions, or both, together with lexA operator-lacZ reporters as indicated in Results. For all fusion proteins, synthesis of a fusion protein of the correct length in yeast cells was confirmed by Western blot (immunoblot) assays of yeast extracts (53) by using polyclonal antiserum specific for LexA (11) or for hemagglutinin (Babco, Inc.), as appropriate. The ability of the LexA fusions used in this study to bind operator DNA was confirmed by repression assay as previously described (11). Activation of the lacZ reporter was determined in liquid beta-galactosidase assays as previously described (12) with EGY48 as the strain background. The numbers shown reflect the average values of assays with at least six independent colonies performed on 2 or 3 different days: deviations in beta-galactosidase values between individually selected colonies were present in less than 30% of the total values obtained. Activation of the LEU2 reporter was determined by observing the growth rate of yeast cells patched on complete minimal medium lacking leucine, because this is the standard method used for evaluating library transformants in interactor screens. At least six independent colonies were analyzed for each pair of constructs. Activation is expressed by the following scale: ++++, growth within 24 to 36 h from a light streak to an essentially saturated patch (i.e., growth on medium lacking leucine equivalent to that on medium containing leucine); +++, growth on leucine-minus medium clearly detectable by eye within 24 to 36 h but with a patch only 20 to 30% as dense as that on medium containing leucine; ++, growth on leucine-minus medium detectable by eye after 48 h, with  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  5822  ESTOJAK ET AL.  MOL. CELL. BIOL.  FIG. 1. Schematic of the interaction trap. A LexA-fused protein of interest is expressed in yeast cells modified so that one or multiple lexA operators are located upstream of a reporter gene (lacZ or LEU2). Potential interacting proteins are expressed as fusions to a transcriptional AD provided by the B42 acid blob (31). The LexA-fused protein binds to the lexA operators but is unable to activate transcription (Transcr.) of the reporter gene in the absence of interaction with the AD-fused partner. When the interaction is of low affinity, the reporter is turned on moderately or not at all; when the interaction is of high affinity, the reporter is strongly transcribed.  growth saturated at 72 to 96 h after streaking; +, outgrowth of microcolonies detectable by dissecting microscope at 48 h and with visible outgrowth of colonies at 4 days; and -, no growth discernible even microscopically at 5 days.  RESULTS Preliminary considerations. In the interaction trap (29, 31) and other two-hybrid systems (6, 13, 17), a first gene is expressed as a protein fusion to a DNA-binding domain to create the bait and a second gene or cDNA library is expressed as a protein fusion to an AD. The bait and the AD fusion are coexpressed in yeast cells in which one or more copies of the binding site for the DNA-binding domain are located upstream of a reporter gene. If the two fused proteins associate, the reporter is transcribed. In screens of cDNA libraries for novel interacting proteins, a dual-reporter system is generally used, with one reporter being lacZ and the second being a gene for a nutritional auxotrophy, such as LEU2 or HIS3. In studies of interactions between predefined sets of proteins, often only a single lacZ reporter is used. Assessment of the strength of interaction between sets of proteins in a two-hybrid system presupposes differential activation of reporter genes by strongly versus weakly interacting protein pairs (Fig. 1). The amount of activation (the penetrance of the interaction phenotype) depends on the magnitude of a number of variables, particularly the fraction of the  operator sites that are occupied by the DNA-binding fusion protein bait, the fraction of operator-bound bait occupied by the AD-tagged protein, differences in the amount of transcription that might arise from differences in the geometry with which DNA-bound ADs are presented to the transcription apparatus, and the amount of transcription necessary to produce a scorable phenotype for a given reporter. The first two variables depend further on the expression level of baits and AD-tagged proteins in the cell and on any competing interactions between yeast proteins and the bait versus those between the bait and AD-fused protein. Some of these variables can be estimated, and some cannot. For example, when tested by repression assays (11), occupancy of at least one operator by bait is typically at least 50%; since occupancy cannot exceed 100%, the variation in this parameter is typically low. Similarly, the AD-tagged proteins are generally expressed to comparable levels, typically estimated to be 102 to 104 (usually &amp;gt;103) molecules per cell, which should result in intranuclear concentrations of 10-7 to 10-5 M (28). Other variables have not been quantified. Effects on transcription due to differences in the precise geometry of DNA-associated transcription domains clearly exist but at present cannot be predicted in advance. Similarly, for most reporters, little is known about how many molecules of mRNA are necessary to express the transcription phenotype. To determine the degree to which the strength of interaction as assayed by a two-hybrid approach parallels biochemically derived estimates of protein affinity, we utilized multiple reporters to systematically measure the interaction phenotypes of closely related pairs of proteins that differed in their oligomerization efficiency, while attempting to hold other variables constant. Expanding the sensitivity range of the interaction trap. In the interaction trap (29, 31), DNA binding is provided by the E. coli LexA protein (11, 12), while the AD is provided by the B42 ``acid blob'' (44), which is a moderately strong activation domain in yeast cells. To maximize the range of interactions detectable, we assembled two series of lexAop-lacZ and lexAopLEU2 reporters (Fig. 2). p1840 (1op-lacZ) has a single LexA binding site (12), pJK103 (2op-lacZ) has a high-affinity, overlapping operator derived from the colEI promoter (18), and pSH18-34 (8op-lacZ) has four colE1-derived operators (29). We also constructed three strains that contained different numbers of lexA operators 220 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the LEU2 gene: EGY191 (2op-LEU2) has a single colE1 operator, EGY195 (4op-LEU2) has two colE1 operators, and EGY48 (6op-LEU2) (29, 31) has three colE1 operators. We previously used the lacZ reporters described above to assist in accurately differentiating the strength of transcriptional activation by different proteins (28). Prior to embarking on large-scale assays of interacting proteins, we performed an initial gauge of the sensitivity of the new lexAop-LEU2 reporter strains. We made LexA fusions to acid blobs B42 and B6 (44) and to an additional protein, HEF1 (previously been shown by beta-galactosidase assay to be medium, fair, and weak activators of transcription, respectively [18a, 28]). We introduced plasmids that expressed LexA-B42, LexA-B6, and LexA-HEF1 and a vector control that expressed LexA into the 2op-LEU2, 4opLEU2, and 6op-LEU2 yeast strains and streaked transformants onto media lacking leucine. LexA-B42 and LexA-B6 stimulated rapid growth of all three strains on leucine-minus medium, whereas native LexA did not (not shown). For LexAHEF1, at 3 days after streaking, 6op-LEU2 yeast cells grew well on leucine-minus medium, 4op-LEU2 yeast cells grew moderately, and 2op-LEU2 yeast cells did not grow (Fig. 3), although  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  VOL. 15, 1995  INTERACTION TRAP­TWO-HYBRID SYSTEM CALIBRATION  5823  FIG. 2. lexA operator-containing strains and reporters.

Small rectangles containing palindromic dark arrows represent lexA operator motifs, each of which binds two monomers of LexA (white rectangle). See text for further detail.  after 6 days, a small number of colonies (&amp;lt;20 per streaked colony) appeared on leucine-minus plates (not shown). We plated dilutions of 6op-LEU2, 4op-LEU2, and 2opLEU2 yeast cells containing these LexA fusions onto media with and without leucine and determined the efficiency of plating (29). Sixty-five percent of 6op-LEU2 cells with LexA-HEF1 formed colonies on leucine-minus medium, compared with 14% of 4op-LEU2 cells and less than 10% of 2op-LEU2 cells (with these last colonies appearing later than those in the other strains). In contrast, all strains containing LexA-B42 and LexA-B6 grew with 100% efficiency on leucine-minus medium. These results show that plating efficiency can vary in a manner that is correlated with the sensitivity of the reporter and indicate that these strains can differentiate weak from moderate transcriptional activation. Interactions between Myc, Max, and Mxi1. The strength of heterodimerization of the helix-loop-helix (47) proteins Myc (1), Max (8, 9), Mad (4), and Mxi1 (60) has been measured either by directly assaying the association in solution in vitro or by using the Kd for binding to consensus DNA motifs to extrapolate an approximate minimum affinity. Max associates with Myc (43), Mad (4), or Mxi1 (60) to form heterodimers that bind DNA when proteins are present at levels of 1 to 5 nM. Myc has been observed to form homodimers at concentrations of 20 muM (15, 43). Finally, while bacterially expressed, unphosphorylated Max homodimerizes and binds DNA at concentrations on the order of 10 to 50 nM (5, 7), eukaryotically expressed Max is phosphorylated by casein kinase II and homodimerizes only at a much higher concentration (greater than 20-fold increase in maximum Kd for dimerization, or 1 muM) (7), suggesting that Max homodimers, like Myc homodimers, are scarce or absent in mammalian cells.  We used the expanded set of reporter strains and plasmids described above to reexamine the interactions of Myc, Max, and Mxi1. We used LexA fusions to Myc and Max and B42-AD fusions to Myc, Max, and Mxi1 to transform yeast cells in conjunction with the lacZ and LEU2 reporters (Fig. 4 and Tables 1 and 2). LexA-fused RPB7 (45) and the B42-AD fusion vector containing no insert were negative controls. We verified that all LexA and B42 fusions were expressed to similar levels with antibody to LexA or to the hemagglutinin epitope tag on the B42 fusion vector (not shown). We have shown previously that the majority of LexA-fused proteins are expressed at intracellular levels of 200 to 800 nM (28), and because of nuclear localization sequences on the fused moiety, intranuclear concentrations are likely to be higher. We measured activation of lacZ reporters by beta-galactosidase assay and activation of the LEU2 reporters by observing the growth of cells patched onto leucine-minus medium (Tables 1 and 2). Pairing of LexA-Myc with AD-Myc or of LexA-Max with AD-Max did not activate transcription of any lacZ or LEU2 reporter. This result agrees with biochemical data that suggest these interactions are of low affinity (maximum affinity in vitro is a Kd of 1 to 20 muM [7, 15, 43]) and implies for this group of proteins that detectable interactions must occur with a Kd of &amp;lt;1 muM. In contrast, LexA-Max interacted strongly with both ADMyc and AD-Mxi1. With the 8op-lacZ, 2op-lacZ, and 1op-lacZ reporters, the LexA-Max and AD-Myc pair gave 278, 172, and 61 U of beta-galactosidase activity; with the 6op-LEU2 and 2opLEU2 reporters, it gave ++ and - growth. On the same reporters, the LexA-Max and AD-Mxi1 pair gave 512, 81, and 4 U of beta-galactosidase activity, respectively, and showed ++++, and ++ growth (Tables 1 and 2). These results parallel the in vitro findings that these proteins associate with high affinity and demonstrate that interactions that occur in vitro with Kds of 1 to 5 nM are easily detectable by interaction trap. However, intriguingly, the rank order of these interactions differed between the lacZ and LEU2 reporter genes and also was dependent on the number of lexA operator sequences present upstream of the reporter gene. Using the most sensitive reporters, 8op-lacZ and 6op-LEU2, Max-Mxi1 appeared to interact more strongly than Max-Myc. However, on less-sensitive reporters, different rankings between lacZ and LEU2 were  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  FIG. 3.

Independent transformants were restreaked either onto uracil-minus, histidineminus, tryptophan-minus, leucine-minus galactose medium to score activation of the LEU2 reporters or onto uracil-minus, histidine-minus, tryptophan-minus galactose medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) to score activation of the lacZ reporters.

In 2op-LEU2 cells, Max-Mxi1 appeared to interact more strongly than Myc-Max (+++ versus -). In 2op-lacZ and 1op-lacZ, Myc-Max dimers appeared to be preferred over Max-Mxi1 (172 versus 81 U and 61 versus 4 U, respectively, for the two reporters). These differences were quite substantial: whereas 1op-lacZ suggested a 17-fold preference for LexAMyc and AD-Max over LexA-Max and AD-Max-Mxi1, 8oplacZ suggested a 1.8-fold preference for LexA-Max and ADMxi1. In addition, the Myc-Max interaction was sensitive to the direction in which it was tested. While LexA-Max and AD-Myc interacted strongly and detectably with most reporters, the interaction between LexA-Myc and AD-Max was only marginably detectable in 6op-LEU2 yeast strains and was not detectable with any lexAop-lacZ reporters. Finally, LexA-Myc interacted with Mxi1, although significantly less than did Max-Mxi1 and Myc-Max heterodimers. We are unaware of in vitro data demonstrating Myc-Mxi1 interactions, and our data in vivo indicate that this interaction has  significantly lower affinity than the interaction between Max and Mxi1; we thus cannot speculate as to its physiological significance. Interactions between lambda cI repressor and repressor mutants. Wild-type repressor (cI-WT) dimerizes with a Kd of 20 nM (55). The E233K mutant has a mild defect in dimerization ability, with a Kd for dimerization estimated to be 50 to 100 nM. A152T and P158T mutants have a Kd for dimer formation estimated to be &amp;gt;1 muM, (a greater than 50-fold reduction relative to the Kd of the wild type). Since the carboxyterminal region (papain fragment c) of cI dimerizes essentially as the full-length wild type but does not form higher-order structures (i.e., tetramers and octamers) (48) that might complicate analysis, we made a series of LexA and AD fusions to residues 132 to 236 (corresponding to this region) of cI-WT repressor and the E233K, A152T, and P158T mutants. We introduced plasmids that directed the synthesis of all possible combinations of these, together with controls, into the 6opLEU2 yeast strain in conjunction with the reporter plasmid 1op-lacZ, 2op-lacZ, or 8op-lacZ. We confirmed expression of comparable levels of correctly sized fusion proteins by Western blots (data not shown) and assayed them for beta-galactosidase activity (Table 3). We first examined the behavior of LexA- and AD-fused proteins with 1op-lacZ, the least-sensitive reporter. The values for LacZ were 182 beta-galactosidase units for cI-cI, 125 U for E233K-E233K, 1 U for A152T-A152T, and 120 U for P158TP158T. The rank order of affinity of these homodimeric interactions approximately paralleled that determined in vitro, although that of the P158T homodimer appeared to be unexpectedly strong. It is worth noting, however, that LexAP158T activated transcription in the absence of any AD-fused partner (see values for the vector control). On this reporter, interactions with Kds of &amp;lt;50 to 100 nM were clearly detected, while the A152T-A152T interaction, with a Kd of &amp;gt;1 muM, was not detected. We then examined the interaction of these protein pairs with a more-sensitive reporter, 2op-lacZ. Here, the strongest single interaction was still that of cI with cI, followed by that of E233K with E233K, followed by that of A152T with A152T. With this reporter, the A152T-A152T interaction was significantly above the background level, suggesting that this reporter can detect interactions with Kds of &amp;gt;1 muM. This ranking paralleled that obtained with 1op-lacZ, but with a compression of affinities in the middle range and with clear detection of weak A152T interactions. On this reporter, LexA-P158T activated transcription of 2op-lacZ extremely strongly in the absence of any interactive partner, limiting the ability to detect interactions when it was used as a bait. Finally, we examined interaction of the cI domains by using the highest-sensitivity 8op-lacZ reporter.

We also note that the negative control protein, LexA-RPB7, showed a moderate level of background activity with all cI variant AD fusions, particularly on the 8op-lacZ reporter. Thus, with this reporter, interactions with Kds of &amp;gt;1 muM are detected, above very high background levels of activity. We also examined heterooligomeric interactions between cI and the cI mutants. On the 1op-lacZ reporter, heterodimers between LexA-cI and AD-E233K and the reciprocal combination LexA-E233K and AD-cI interacted with apparent affinity comparable to that of the E233K-E233K interactions (76 and 151 U, respectively). The interactions between LexA-cI and AD-A152T and the reciprocal interaction between LexAA152T and AD-cI resulted in somewhat less induction of the 1op-lacZ reporter (47 and 49 U, respectively). Still weaker were interactions between LexA-cI and AD-P158T and LexAE233K and either AD-P158T or AD-A152T, ranging from 23 to 36 U. Of the lowest affinity, and essentially indistinguishable from the background level of activity, were interactions of the LexA-A152T fusion with AD-E233K, AD-P158T, and ADA152T. Finally, examination of the LexA-P158T data suggests that this protein can heterodimerize moderately, with the greatest degree of heterodimerization occurring with cI and E233K and the least occurring with A152T, although because of the high background level of transcription, this is not directly comparable with the other data. On the 2op-lacZ reporter, the strongest heteromeric interaction was that between LexA-cI and E233K, followed by those between LexA-cI and A152T and P158T, LexA-E233K and AD-P158T or AD-A152T, and LexA-A152T and AD-cI. Finally, the LexA-A152T fusion in conjunction with AD-E233K, AD-P158T, or AD-A152T yielded values significantly above background. LexA-P158T activated transcription of 2op-lacZ extremely strongly in the absence of any interactive partner, limiting its usefulness as a probe. This rank order paralleled that obtained with 1op-lacZ, but with a compression of differences in the middle range and clear detection of the weaker A152T interactions. In contrast, with the 8op-lacZ reporter, there were numerous deviations in rank order of affinity of interactions and general compression of differences between different protein pairs. Taken together, these results indicated that the 1op-lacZ reporter was able to detect and discriminate between interactions with affinities predicted to range from 20 nM to close to 1 muM, with interactions with affinities of less than 1 muM not detected. The 2op-lacZ reporter was comparable but allowed more resolution of differences between weaker interactions and detection of interactions in the range of 1 muM. Finally, the 8op-lacZ reporter allowed clear detection of interactions in the  1 muM range but had high background levels of activity for many of the baits and showed compression of differences between strong and moderate interactions. We then tested combinations of LexA-cI and AD-cI proteins with the LEU2 reporters. In contrast to the results with the Myc-Max-Mxi1 proteins, in which the data from the LEU2 reporters approximately paralleled those from the lacZ reporters, when used with the cI proteins, the LEU2 reporters did not detect interactions. In 2op-LEU2, the presence of LexA-cI, -E233K, or -A152T alone or in conjunction with any AD-fused partner did not permit growth on leucine-minus medium (not shown). In 6op-LEU2, the presence of LexA-cI, -E233K, or -A152T alone resulted in moderate growth of yeast cells on leucine-minus medium that was unaffected by the presence of an AD-fused partner protein. In both 2op-LEU2 and 6opLEU2, expression of the LexA-P158T fusion alone or in conjunction with any AD-fused protein resulted in strong activation of the reporter, making it impossible to score any activation resulting from interaction. DISCUSSION These experiments have allowed us to draw a number of conclusions about the use of two-hybrid/interaction trap methods to study protein interaction. First, for a number of proteins known to dimerize with in vitro Kds ranging from 20 muM to 2 nM, it is possible to discriminate high-, intermediate-, and low-affinity interactions on the basis of the relative ability to activate transcription of a reporter. Second, such rankings of interaction strength are facilitated by the use of multiple reporter systems. Third, the measured relative strengths of interactions varied in a manner dependent on which reporter construct was used. Fourth, in scoring related groups of fusion proteins, individual reporters demonstrated thresholds corresponding to the minimum affinity of interaction required to score as positive. Different groups of fusion proteins possessed different thresholds. In general, some reporters only recognized moderate-to-high-affinity interactions (Kd for dimerization, &amp;lt;1 muM), while others were also responsive to weak interactions (Kd for dimerization, &amp;gt;1 muM). Fifth, in no case did differences in activation of a single reporter gene correspond linearly to differences in dimerization affinity reported in vitro. Sixth, in some cases, interaction was detected when one partner was the bait and the other carried an AD but were not observed in the other orientation (directionality). These results have significant implications for two-hybrid/interaction trap studies of protein interactions and for screens of libraries to look for new interacting partners. Finally, the lexAop-LEU2 reporters we describe should be valuable for future studies of protein interaction. Comparison of in vivo and in vitro measures of Myc-MaxMxi1 heterodimerization. In agreement with earlier findings, our data indicate that Myc (15, 43) and Max (7, 38, 43) homodimers are disfavored, while both Myc-Max (8, 9) and MaxMxi1 (60) can form heterodimers with high affinity. Our data suggest that the affinity of the Mxi1-Max dimerization is comparable to that of Myc-Max. This finding agrees with those of previous experiments in which the dimerization affinities of Myc-Max and Max-Mad were extrapolated from binding affinities to the CACGTG DNA consensus site in vitro (4). Furthermore, this ordering of affinities is compatible with those in recent experiments in which cotransfection of equimolar quantities of Mad or Mxi with Myc in a transformation assay resulted in a greater than 90% reduction in formation of foci (40). However our results emphasize the difficulty of attempting to quantitate differences in affinity from two-hybrid exper Downloaded  from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  5826  ESTOJAK ET AL.  MOL. CELL. BIOL.  iments alone. For example, depending on the lacZ reporter used, the LexA-Max­AD-Myc interaction could be assumed to be 18-fold stronger or 2-fold weaker than the LexA-Max­ADMxi1 interaction, while the LEU2 reporters both identify the LexA-Max­AD-Mxi1 interaction as stronger. The point on which all reporters concurred was in repeatedly identifying these two sets of interactions over other presumably nonphysiological interactions. For this group of proteins, our data indicate that strong interactions (Kds of 1 to 10 nM) are detected strongly by the interaction trap, while weak interactions (Kds of &amp;gt;1 muM), thought to be nonbiological for this group of proteins, are not. Other considerations affecting the interpretation of these interactions, and in particular the directional nature of the Myc-Max interaction, are discussed further below. Comparison of in vivo and in vitro measures of cI protein and mutant homo- and heterodimerization. Bacteriophage lambda repressor is an important model system for the study of DNAprotein and protein-protein interactions, and a wealth of data bearing on both processes exists. E233K (originally isolated as inds-1), P158T, and A152T all bind operators with lower affinity than cI and are more sensitive to recA-dependent cleavage, which targets only monomers (14). Previous estimations of dimerization affinity have suggested that the defect in P158T is most severe (Kd, &amp;gt;1 muM), that in A152T is intermediate (Kd, 1 muM), and that in E233K is least severe (Kd, 50 to 100 nM) (14, 26, 33). Our data generally agree with this ranking (Table 3 [results with LexA-cI]). However, the A152T dimer data obtained with the three reporters illustrate the difficulty of using transcription to draw simple conclusions about relative interaction affinity. Depending on which reporter is used, A152T-A152T affinity is 200-fold less, 7-fold less, or 2-fold greater than that of cI-cI homodimers. In this case, the data from the least-sensitive 1op-lacZ reporter most closely parallel the in vitro data. Notably, the LEU2 reporters proved completely unable to detect interactions for this set of proteins. While the reason for this failure remains unclear, a number of differences between the reporters are discussed below. Interactions between different heterodimeric pairs of cI mutants have not been previously quantitated. However, it is reasonable to assume that these affinities are likely to fall between a Kd of 20 nM (wild-type cI homodimerization and &amp;gt;1 muM (P158T mutant homodimerization). Our data are consistent with this idea, and several different levels of affinity can be discerned. Of the highest affinity are heterodimers between cI and E233K. The next highest affinities are those between cI and A152T, followed by those between E233K and A152T. Moreover, despite the fact that the LexA-P158T protein activates transcription (for reasons that remain opaque), our data indicate that it interacts with other cI proteins with similar affinity to or perhaps slightly lower affinity than A152T. All of these rankings are in accord with predictions based on the homodimerization constants and support the idea that the interaction trap can meaningfully order the affinity of protein variants (29, 31). Considerations affecting affinity measurements. At the simplest level, the amount of interaction between two protein components in a two-hybrid/interaction trap method is a function of the affinity of the AD-tagged protein for the DNAbound bait. Our results have for the most part supported the idea that when other variables are held constant, affinity is the predominant determinant of the magnitude of the transcription we measure. However, our results also show that the apparent interaction affinities are affected by other considerations that we do not fully understand. The most striking departure of our results from those predicted from in vitro affinity is that one of the interactions--that  SH1834, 8op-lacZ LexA-RPB7 JK103, 2op-lacZ 1840, 1op-lacZ SH1834, 8op-lacZ LexA-P158Tb  TABLE 3. cI and cI mutant interaction-dependent activation of lacZ reporters containing different numbers of lexA operatorsa  1,726 1,824 1,295 848 959  3 2 2 6 2  14 8 8 19 3  30 21 39 85 3  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  JK103, 2op-lacZ 1840, 1op-lacZ SH1834, 8op-lacZ JK103, 2op-lacZ 1840, 1op-lacZ SH1834, 8op-lacZ JK103, 2op-lacZ  beta-Galactosidase activity (U)  LexA-A152T  LexA-E233K  167 301 90 94 5 cI-WT E233K A152T P158T Vector 182 76 47 36 2 588 351 139 112 5 434 364 188 144 10 151 125 29 23 3  460 442 45 214 9 a b  50 6 1 7 2 Results reflect calibration of lambda and dimerization-deficient mutants.

All fusion proteins were expressed, so the mechanism underlying directionality is unclear, but this phenomenon has been observed for numerous protein pairs in two-hybrid systems, including a number of Cdk and cyclin-related proteins (22, 23); such directionality might be explained by positing that oligomerization of some baits obscures residues on these proteins needed to interact with the AD-tagged protein. In a similar vein, it has also been noted that some proteins such as Rel (35) or Gfi-1 (25), which have important functional domains at their amino termini, possess markedly different phenotypes in transcription-based assays, depending on whether LexA is fused to the amino terminus or the carboxy terminus or is absent (30, 35). An additional difference between the results expected from in vitro data and those obtained in this study lay in the dependence of the rank order of interactions on the reporter used. These fell into two classes. First, the reporter gene used was sometimes significant. For the cI proteins used in these experiments, the lacZ reporters produced rankings comparable to those biochemically determined, while the LEU2 reporters did not yield utilizable data. This is at variance with some cases in which the LEU2 reporters, particularly the highly sensitive 6op-LEU2, can detect biologically relevant interactions which the lacZ reporters cannot (16, 27). Second, the number of lexA operators present on a reporter was significant. We have previously shown that the number of operators upstream of lacZ can affect estimation of the strength of LexA-activator proteins (28). In this study we found similar bias occurring: in particular, we observed compression of differences in activation for strongly interacting pairs when reporters with large numbers of lexA operators were used. Several factors might contribute to directionality or promoter bias. First, the LEU2 and lacZ reporter series are quite different. They contain different promoter sequences, which might affect the number of ADs brought to the DNA, and the geometry with which the interacting activation domain is presented to the transcription apparatus; they are present in different numbers of copies intracellularly (1 for the chromosomal LEU2 reporters, 20 for the lacZ reporters); and, in these experiments, the lacZ reporters were carried on plasmids, while the LEU2 reporters are integrated into the chromosome. Such differences between reporter systems are not unique to the interaction trap or other two-hybrid systems; in bacteria, the choice of reporter gene has been shown to have an impact on measurement of transcriptional activation (24). Second, each LexA fusion and AD fusion is a unique chimeric protein. We have previously shown that different fused moieties can affect the interaction of LexA with operator sequences (28). For any given protein, it is possible that either LexA, the AD, or oligomerization dependent on the fused moiety may obscure residues necessary for interaction or interfere with the conformation of the protein in such a way as to render it unable to interact. Either the LexA-fused or ADfused protein may associate with extraneous yeast proteins, and these associations could bias all of the considerations presented above. Given these issues, our data suggest that prudent use of a two-hybrid system to study protein interactions would involve an initial assay of a low-sensitivity lacZ reporter, a high-sensitivity lacZ reporter, and at least one LEU2 reporter and should test interactions in both orientations. Finally, particularly in the case of the cI repressor mutants studied, we note that the potential dimeric interactions occurring are more complex than the heterodimerizations between the LexA-fused component and the AD-fused component with  which this discussion primarily deals. LexA binds its operator sequences as a dimer (10) and possesses dimerization functions in its carboxy-terminal domain. The cI proteins were chosen as a test set because they also possessed an intrinsic ability to homodimerize. Thus, we would expect that yeast cells also express some AD-cI/AD-cI homodimers, some LexA-cI/ LexA-cI homodimers in which dimerization is mediated in part by the cI domain, and, inevitably, LexA-cI/LexA-cI homodimers in which dimerization is mediated by the LexA carboxy terminus, in addition to the LexA-cI/AD-cI heterodimers whose interaction we are assaying in the final transcription phenotype induced. Because we are able to assay the LexA-P1/AD-P2 interaction, it is clear that the capacity to homodimerize does not preclude the use of a two-hybrid approach. Rather, it is perhaps impressive that the system does as well as our data indicate in ranking heterodimeric interactions of different affinities in the background of possible homodimeric noise. Implications for library screening. Perhaps the most common current use of two-hybrid­interaction trap technologies is to select new interacting partners from interaction cDNA libraries. Our work here has a number of implications for that application. First, our results support the idea that through judicious choice of reporters, it should be possible to isolate interacting proteins that are physiologically significant to the chosen bait, whether this describes interactions occurring with affinities of 20 nM or those occurring with affinities of 1 muM. Second, to date, baits that activate transcription have been unsuitable for use in interactor hunts because of the background of growth they induce in 6op-LEU2 reporter strains. Because of their decreased sensitivity, the 4op-LEU2 and 2opLEU2 reporter strains are suitable for hunts with some such baits (39, 42, 46). Third, given the fact that most current two-hybrid/interaction trap library screens depend on dual-phenotype strategies, one intriguing implication of our data is that the pool of positive clones selected may be biased by which of the two reporters is used first. Proteins that appear to interact strongly on the basis of the LEU2 phenotype but which activate even a sensitive lacZ reporter only weakly may still be valid (16, 23). Since the reporters used in GAL4-based two-hybrid experiments are different from those used here, it is not unreasonable to imagine that some interactions might be detected differently in these systems (13, 17), such that nonidentical sets of protein interactors are obtained. In addition, the directionality we and others have observed suggests an explanation for interactor hunts that fail to identify known protein partners. Fourth, our pilot experiments demonstrated that increased activation strength at the LEU2 reporters resulted in an increase in the proportion of cells in a population able to form colonies on leucine-minus medium rather than a general variance in the growth rate of all cells in a population. This variation in plating efficiency implies both that activation of the LEU2 reporters varies over a substantial range from cell to cell and that there must exist a threshold of LEU2 transcription that is necessary for a cell to form a colony. Such a threshold effect has been previously described for transcription of higher eukaryotic genes (21) and may in fact describe the situation of the lacZ reporters as well; however, lacZ activity is assayed as the average of a population. Heterogeneity of expression may affect the interpretation of the significance of cDNAs isolated from colonies in interactor hunts that arose from a nutritional selection, since colonies are derived from single founder cells (26, 27). In conventional library screening--a labelled probe or an antibody against a filter--the number of hybridizing organisms reflects the frequency with which the clone appears in the  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  5828  ESTOJAK ET AL.

In an auxotrophy screen with a LexA-X bait, if one cDNA, Y, is isolated 50 times and a second cDNA, Z, is isolated 5 times, this may reflect the abundance of Y and Z, if the two have equivalent affinity for X, but it is equally likely to reflect the fact that Y has a higher affinity for X than Z does. In conclusion, this study highlights the utility of the interaction trap in identifying and analyzing interactions between proteins. The fact that affinity measurements by two-hybrid/ interaction trap systems are subject to variables such as those we have described is not surprising and does not vitiate the fact that these systems represent a powerful tool for rapidly establishing the preliminary strength of interactions, which should aid in the daunting task of assessing the roles of ever-increasing numbers of genes.

																																		<Abstract>Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.</Abstract>

Surprisingly, inactivation of the IRS-1 gene in the mouse by using the homologous recombination approach did not result in any dramatic pathological phenotype, indicating the possible existance of alternative signalling pathways [5,6]. A number of studies performed mainly with IR have provided evidence that some effector proteins such as the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, GTPase activating protein (GAP) and SYP (SH2-domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase) could directly bind via their SH2 domains to phosphotyrosines of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor [7-11] and this could represent an alternative mechanism by which some signalling pathways could be activated or regulated. In IR, the binding site for p85 and SYP has been mapped to the C-terminal y1322 and for G A P to the NPXY motif at y96o [12]. Interaction of these proteins with IGF- 1R has not been examined in detail and only weak direct interaction of p85 with IGF-1R has been reported [13,141. Recently, the two-hybrid approach [15,16] was applied to investigate the interaction of IRS-1 with the cytoplasmic fl domain of IR [17]. In the work reported here, we have used the two-hybrid system to perform a comparative analysis of direct interaction of p85 with the cytoplasmic fl domain of IR and IGF-1R. 2. Experimental 1. Introduction The insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) are very homologous in their primary as well as their heterodimeric ~2~2structure and belong to the family of membrane receptors with tyrosine kinase activity [1]. It is well established that receptor autophosphorylation upon ligand binding and activation of the tyrosine kinase domain are required for most, if not all, of the biological effects of insulin and IGF-1. The molecular basis of the differential signalling by these two receptors leading to common as well as specific biological effects is still not entirely understood. One of the mechanisms of signalling by IR and IGF-1R consists in the phosphorylation by the activated receptor tyrosine kinase of intermediate docking proteins such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and SHC which subsequently bind various Src homology 2 (SH2)-domain containing effector proteins that activate different signalling pathways [2,3]. For instance, the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase binds to phosphotyrosines at YXXM motifs [4] in IRS-1 and *Corresponding author. Fax: (33) (1) 44 41 24 62.

Plasmid construction All Escherichia coli (strain HB 101) and DNA manipulations were  Abstract Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic/3 domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR/] and IGF-1R/3, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IRE. Interaction of p85 and N + C-SH2 with IR/3(AC-43) or IGF1R/3(AC-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y~°/F for IR or YgS°/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR~I(AC-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR/3. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R/3 was 4-fold less as compared to IRI~ and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R/3(AC-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

Enzymes used for cloning were from Biolabs and Pfu DNA polymerase from Gibco-BRL. Primers used for PCR were purchased from Genosys and all 5'-deoxynucleotide triphosphates were from Boehringer. Plasmids carrying cloned fulllength cDNAs encoding IR [19,20] and p85 [21 23] were generously provided by A. Ullrich and cloned full-length cDNA for IGF-1R [24,25] was obtained from P. De Meyts. The plasmids used for hybrid gene constructs were pBTMll6 ([26]; carrying trpl) and pGAD GH ([27]; carrying leu2), encoding the DNA binding domain of LEXA and GAL4 activation domain (GAD), respectively. The DNAs corresponding to the cytoplasmic IRfl and IGF-1Rfl were PCR amplified using cloned cDNAs with different sets of the following primers (5' to 3'): CGCGAATTCAGAAAGAGGCAGCCAGATGG (R1), CGCGGATCCTTAGGAAGGATTGGACCGAG (R2), CGCGAATTCAGAAAGAGAAATAACAGCAG(R3), CGCGGATCCAAGGATCAGCAGGT (R4), CGCGGATCCTTACTCCTCCCTCTGACAGTGCG (R5), CGCGGATCCTTACTTGTGTCCTGAGTGTCTGT (R6),CGCGAATTCAGAAAGAGGCAGCCAGATGGGCCGCTGGGACCGCTTTACGCTTCTTCAAACCCTGAGTTTCTCAG (R7), CGCGAATTCAGAAAGAGAAATAACAGCAGGCTGGGGAATGGAGTGCTGTATGCCTCTGTGAACCCGGAGTTCTTCAG (R8), CGCGGATCCTTAGGTCGAAGACTGGGGCAGCG (R9).

Western immunoblot analysis of hybrid proteins Ten milliliters of selective medium (lacking Trp and Leu) with 2% glucose were seeded with overnight cultures from colonies of selected yeast strains to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2 and incubated at 30°C until the optical density reached 0.5. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in 400 ,ul of sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) sample buffer and vortexed with glass beads. After centrifugation, the supernanant was collected, boiled and 10/A were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [29]. The proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose [30] and LEXA hybrid proteins were detected by using an antibody against the DNA binding domain of LEXA (obtained from E Moreau) and the ECL detection system (Amersham).  2.2.

Results and discussion The two-hybrid system represents a genetic approach to characterize protein-protein interactions in yeast [15,16]. Basically, the two proteins are expressed in yeast as two hybrids: one with the D N A binding domain of a transcription factor (i.e. L E X A ) and other with the activation domain of a transcription factor (i.e. GAL4). The yeast strains used possess his3 and/or lacZ carrying upstream activating sequences that allow transcriptional activation of these genes if a functional transcription factor is reconstituted upon protein-protein interaction between the two hybrids. This approach has been applied here to analyse the interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with I R and I G F - 1 R .  SH3  N-SH2  C-SH2  N-SH2  C-SH2  N-SH2  C-SH2  N-~2  3.1.

Hybrids of LEXA with fl(AC-43) in which C-terminal 43 aa were deleted or with fl(AC-43) further containing Y96°/F mutation for IR and Y95°/F for IGF-1R were also engineered (Fig. 1A). In the case of IGF-1R, fl(C]337/A) in which the terminal C 1337was deleted was also fused to LEXA. The structure of various GAD hybrid proteins with p85 or its subdomains is shown in Fig. lB. Western immunoblot analysis of protein extracts for yeast strains transfected with plasmids encoding LEXA or its hybrid proteins showed that all the proteins were expressed (Fig. 2). We assume that GAD hybrid proteins are also expressed even though attempts to detect these proteins were unsuccessful due to high background and unspecific reactions obtained with the antibodies against GAD which we used. partially purified IR but not of IR deleted for the C-terminal 43 aa by glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins containing p85 or its subdomains and (ii) the ability of various pY peptides to inhibit this precipitation [7,12]. The ability of p85 or its subdomains to bind to LEXA-IRfl(AC-43) was thus examined (Fig. 3). From his3 activation, it can be concluded that the  6 · 50  LEXA-IRp LEXA'IRI?,(AC-43)  []  · []  &amp;gt;c 4 e::3  LEXA-IGF-1Rp LEXA-IGF-1R~(,~C-43)  3.2. Interaction of p85 with IR Yeast strains coexpressing LEXA-IRfl and GAD hybrid proteins with p85, N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2 or SH3 + N-SH2 initially selected on minimal medium lacking Trp and Leu were all able to grow on the same medium also lacking His (Fig. 3). Activation of his3 in these transformed strains provides genetic evidence that p85 or its subdomains can directly interact with IRfl. The growth of yeast strains resulting from such interactions is comparable to the growth of a yeast strain coexpressing hybrid proteins of LEXA and GAD with RAS and RAF, respectively (Fig. 3), two proteins that are known to interact strongly [26]. The SH3 domain of p85 did not interact with IRfl. Finally, no his3 activation was obtained when GAD-p85 was coexpressed with hybrid of LEXA with Adhalin ([32]; obtained from J. Chelly), a protein unrelated to insulin signalling. It is known that the SH2 domains of p85 bind to phosphotyrosines at YXXM motifs [4]. Recently, the binding site of p85 in IR was mapped to the YTHM motif at y]322 in the Cterminal domain on the basis of (i) in vitro precipitation of  3"ID  ·' ~  2 1-  I  GAD-pS5  I  Fig.  4. fl-Galactosidase activity in protein extracts from yeast strains transformed with plasmids encoding GAD-p85 and LEXA hybrid proteins as indicated. The mean value of at least three independent experiments is presented. In each case, the values differed less than 10% from  one experiment to another. A blank value (~ 10 units) obtained with an extract from yeast strain expressingGAD/LEXA had been substracted.  54 interaction of N-SH2, C-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 with IRfl is indeed abolished upon deleting the C-terminal 43 aa. However, p85 and N + C-SH2 continue to interact with IRfl(AC-43) thus revealing the presence of a second internal binding site that is not capable of binding any of the single SH2 domains used here. In a previous study examining direct interaction of p85 with IR using an immunoprecipitation/cross-linking approach, y960 was implicated as a possible binding site for p85 [8]. We therefore introduced y96°]F mutation in IRfl(AC-43) and showed that this mutation did not have any effect on his3 activation using p85 or N + C-SH2 (Fig. 3). Interaction of p85 with IRfl as well as with IRfl(AC-43) was further examined by analysing activation of lacZ reporter (Fig. 4). Quantitative analysis showed that activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IRfl(AC-43) was decreased 4-fold as compared to IRfl. 3.3. Interaction o f p85 with IGF-1R Activation of his3 was observed in yeast strains coexpressing LEXA-IGF-1Rfl and G A D hybrid proteins with p85, N + CSH2 and C-SH2, indicating direct interaction between p85 and IGF-1Rfl (Fig 3). In contrast to what was observed with IRfl, no interaction between N-SH2 or SH3 + N-SH2 and IGF-1Rfl was detected. The cytoplasmic fl domains of IR and IGF-1R are very similar [241 and a YAHM motif can also be found at y1316at the C-terminal part o f l G F - 1 R . The ability of p85 or its subdomains to activate his3 upon binding to IGF-1Rfl(AC-43) indicates that as for the IRfl(AC-43), p85 and N + C-SH2 continue to interact with IGF-1Rfl(AC-43) whereas the binding of C-SH2 was abolished (Fig. 3). This internal binding was not affected when Y95°/F mutation was introduced in IGF-1Rfl(AC-43). Interestingly, growth of yeast strains upon his3 activation resulting from interaction between p85 and IGF-1Rfl(/IC-43) appeared to be higher as compared to IGF-1Rfl. This observation was confirmed by analysing lacZ activation that was 2-fold higher with p85 and IGF- 1Rfl(AC-43) as compared to I G F - 1Rfl (Fig. 4). Since IGF-1R contains a C residue at the C-terminus that is not present in IR, one could imagine that C 1337 might be involved in a disulfide bond that could somehow hinder binding of p85 to IGF-1R. This was not the case since p85 or its subdomains interact equally well with IGF-1Rfl(CI337/A) and IGF-1Rfl (Fig. 3). 3.4. Differential interaction o f p85 with IR and IGF-1R A comparative analysis of the interaction of p85 with IRfl and IGF-1Rfl using the two-hybrid system indicates that the interaction of p85 with IR is much stronger as compared to IGF-1R. These results are compatible with previous immunoprecipitation studies that reported only weak interaction between p85 and IGF-1R [13,14]. Deletion of the C-terminal 43 aa in IRfl lead to a decreased interaction with p85 whereas in the case of IGF-1Rfl, this deletion rather resulted in a slight increase in the interaction with p85. In conclusion, it is tempting to speculate that the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R might exert a negative control on the binding of p85 thereby providing a means of regulating the activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway upon its interaction with I G F 1R. Such control might represent one of the mechanisms which could contribute to achieving specificity in metabolic versus mitogenic signalling by these two receptors. In addition, IR and  R Lamothe et al./FEBS Letters 373 (1995) 51-55 IGF-1R appear to contain two sites for the binding of p85: one site comprising the C-terminal YXXM motif and a second internal site which remains to be characterized.

																																		<Abstract>Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.</Abstract>

Analysis with insulin and anti-receptor antibodies. P A Wilden , K Siddle , E Haring , J M Backer , M F White and C R Kahn Research Division, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02215. Abstract The role of specific tyrosine autophosphorylation sites in the human insulin receptor kinase domain (Tyr1158, Tyr1162, and Tyr1163) was analyzed using in vitro mutagenesis to replace tyrosine residues individually or in combination. Each of the three single-Phe, the three possible double-Phe a triple-Phe and a triple-Ser mutant receptors, stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, were compared with the wild-type receptor in their ability to mediate stimulation of receptor kinase activity, glycogen synthesis, and DNA synthesis by insulin or the human-specific anti-receptor monoclonal antibody 83-14. At a concentration of 0.1 nM insulin which produced approximately half-maximal responses with wild-type receptor, DNA synthesis and glycogen synthesis mediated by the three single-Phe mutants ranged from 52 to 88% and from 32 to 79% of the wild-type receptor, respectively. The corresponding figures for the double-Phe mutants averaged 15 and 6%, whereas the triple-mutants were unresponsive in both assays. The level of biological function approximately paralleled the insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity in the intact cell as estimated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its endogenous substrate pp 185/IRS-1. Interestingly, all mutants showed a marked decrease in insulin-stimulated receptor internalization. Anti-receptor antibody stimulated receptor kinase activity and mimicked insulin action in these cells. In general, the impairment of the metabolic response was greater and impairment of the growth response was less when antibody was the stimulus. These experiments show that the level and specific sites of autophosphorylation are critical determinants of receptor function. The data are consistent with a requirement for the receptor tyrosine kinase either as an obligatory step or a modulator, in both metabolic and growth responses, and demonstrate the important role of the level of insulin receptor kinase domain autophosphorylation in regulating insulin sensitivity.

																																			<Abstract>The heterotrimeric G protein, G alpha i2, transduces signals from seven membrane spanning receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and ion channels. The purpose of this study was to identify these or other cellular proteins that interact with G alpha i2 by use of the yeast two-hybrid system. A human B cell cDNA library was screened by this system using full length G alpha i2. Four positive colonies were obtained. Two of the four were identified as nucleobindin, a calcium binding protein and a putative antigen to which anti-nuclear antibodies are generated in mice with a disorder that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus. Nucleobindin has a leucine zipper, EF hands, and a signal peptide sequence and is thought to localize to the nucleus as well as being secreted. The specificity of intehraction between G alpha i2 and nucleobindin was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins. Transfection of G alpha i2 and nucleobindin in COS cells increased G alpha i2 expression relative to cells transfected with G alpha i2 and mock vector. Our results indicate that the yeast two-hybrid system provides a means to identify novel proteins that interact with G alpha proteins. Nucleobindin appears to represent one of those proteins.</Abstract>

<BodyText>FEBS 16103  FEBS Letters 373 (1995) 155-158  Interaction of the protein nucleobindin with Gai2, as revealed by the yeast two-hybrid system Naoki Mochizuki a, Masahiko HibP, Yoshiyuki Kanai b, Paul A. Insel a'* ~Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093~)636, USA bDepartment of Molecular Oncology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108, Japan  Received 18 August 1995 data have suggested that G~ can be identified in the nuclei of cells [10]. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system [11] as a means to seek for previously unrecognized targets that could couple to G~i2. In this report, we identify one protein that appears to interact with G~i2: the h u m a n homolog of nucleobindin, a previously cloned protein that was originally identified as a putative auto-antigen in a model of systemic lupus erythematosus [121.  Abstract The heterotrimeric G protein, G~i2, transduces signals from seven membrane spanning receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and ion channels. The purpose of this study was to identify these or other cellular proteins that interact with G,d2 by use of the yeast two-hybrid system. A human B cell cDNA library was screened by this system using full length Gin2. Four positive colonies were obtained. Two of the four were identified as nucleobindin, a calcium binding protein and a putative antigen to which anti-nuclear antibodies are generated in mice with a disorder that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus. Nucleobindin has a leucinc zipper, EF hands, and a signal peptide sequence and is thought to localize to the nucleus as well as being secreted. The specificity of intehraction between G~2 and nucleobindin was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins. Transfeetion of Gai2 and nucleobindin in COS cells increased G~i2 expression relative to cells transfected with Goi2 and mock vector. Our results indicate that the yeast two-hybrid system provides a means to identify novel proteins that interact with G,~ proteins. Nucleobindin appears to represent one of those proteins. Key words.

Growth and handling of yeast strain and Escherichia coli strains The yeast strain used in this work was provided by S. Elledge (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston). The strain was Y190 (MATs gal4 gall80 his3 trpl-190 ade2 101 ura3 52 leu2 3,-112 URA3 :: GAL-lacZ, LYS2:: GAL(UAS)-HIS3 cyhr). Yeast were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract/2% peptone/2% glucose, pH 5.8) or in the SD synthetic medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen basel2% glucose with appropriate auxotrophic amino acids). E. coli strains of XL-1 blue (Strategene) and HB101 (Promega) were used for the purification of plasmids. Transformation of the yeast strain with vectors was undertaken by using modified instructions in the MATCHMAKER Two Hybrid System (Clontech). 2.2, Plasmid construction and library for the yeast two-hybrid system In the yeast two-hybrid system, proteins linked to the amino-terminal domain that mediate DNA binding join to proteins linked to the carboxy-terminal domain involved in activation of GAL4 transcription [11]. Yeast cloning vectors containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain, pGBT9 and other control vectors, pVA3 containing the p53/GAL4 DNA-binding domain, pTD1 containing SV40 large T-antigen/GAL4 activation domain, and pLAM5' containing a human lamin C/GAL4 DNA-binding domain were obtained from Clontech. pACT containing the GAL4 activation domain and pACT into which a human B cell cDNA library was cloned were kind gifts from S. Elledge. pGBT-Gq, which contains the entire coding sequence of G~q, was inserted in-frame to pGBT9. The entire coding sequence was amplified by PCR using the P3 vector (from M. Simon, Caltech) containing the entire coding sequence of mouse G~q cDNA as a template, pGBT-G~2 contained inframe the entire coding sequence of rat G~2 cDNA amplified from pG113 obtained from Y. Kaziro, DNAX. The following oligonucleotides were used for the amplification of G~q and G~2, G~q forward primer: 5'-CCCGGGGATCCGTATGACTCTGGAGTCCATCAT-G3' including the BamHl site, G~q reverse primer: 5'AAGTCGACGGATCCTTAGACCAGATTGTACTCCTTG-3' including the BamHl site, G~2 forward primer: 5'-TCTCGAGAATTCATGGGCTGCACCGTGAGC-3' including the EcoR1 site before the initiation codon, G~2 reverse: 5'-AAGCTTGTCGACTCAGAAGAGGCCACAGTCCTT- 3' including the SalI site before the termination codon. PCR conditions were as follows: first denaturation: 3 rain at 95°C, 30 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95°C, annealing for 30 s at 55°C and extension for 30 s at 72°C. PCR products of G~q and G~,2 were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, purified from agarose gel and ligated into pGBT9. pGST G~2 contain the entire coding sequence of G~2 expressed as a fusion protein to GST. The coding sequence was amplified by the set of forward and reverse primers; 5'-GGTGGAATTCTAATGGGCTGCACCGTGAGCGCC-3' and 5'-AAGCTTGTCGACTCAGAAGA 1.  Introduction Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) transduce signals derived from receptor interaction of stimuli, such as peptide hormones, neurotransmitters, light and odorants, to various cellular effectors [1], Pertussis toxin sensitive G~ subunits of the G~ family (G~i, G~o, and G~z) have been shown to regulate adenylyl cyclases, K ÷ channels, and Ca 2+ channels [2~]. One of these proteins, G~i3, has been localized not only to the plasma membrane but also to the Golgi apparatus, where it appears to be involved in the secretion of proteins [5]. G~i2, which interacts with adenylyl cyclase, causes neoplastic transformation of some types of cells when mutated to a constitutively active state [6]. G~i2 may also be involved in the regulation of cell differentiation and in transmission of signals from %-adrenergic receptors to the p21 ras-mitogen activated protein kinase pathway [7,8]. These findings suggest that G~ proteins not only act as transducers of signals from the plasma membrane but also may play roles in unrecognized signalling pathways in other cellular compartments [9].

The amplified products were digested with EcoRI and Sail, and ligated in-frame into pGEX-KG, which is a derivative of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia). pBluescript (pBS)-Nuc contained human nucleobindin cDNA. pcDNA-Gi: was made by ligation of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) digested with EcoRl and the EcoRI fragment from pGI 13 that contained rat G~2 cDNA, including the 5' non-coding region and the entire coding sequence digested with EcoRl. pcDNANuc was constructed with the ligation of pcDNA digested with EcoRI and the EcoRI fragment from pBS-Nuc. All of the plasmids used in this experiment were sequenced in both directions by the Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp) and/or analyzed by combinations of restriction enzyme digestion. 2.3. Library screening with the yeast two-hybrid system Y190 was transformed with pGBT-G~2 using the lithium acetate procedure and grown on the SD plate in the absence of Trp. Colonies that appeared on the plate did not have transcription activation activity by themselves. Transformants with pGBT-G~2 were grown in the SD medium and sequentially transformed by 200/~g of the human B cell library inserted into pACT. Transformants were incubated on SD plates with 50 mM of 3-aminotriazole in the absence of Ura, Leu, Trp and His. Clones that could grow in the absence of His and that could activate the lacZ reporter gene were isolated. Plasmids containing an activation domain and protein that interacted with G ~ in the yeast were purified from lacZ positive colonies. HB101 transformed with plasmids purified from yeast that could grow in the absence of Leu on the M9 plates possessed the activation domain plasmids. 2.4. Qualitative and quantitative fl-galactosidase assays A filter assay for qualitative analysis offl-galactosidase and liquid culture assay for fl-galactosidase were performed according to the instructions of the MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System. Data for quantitative assays are mean _+S.D. of triplicate assays representing Miller's units. 2.5. In vitro binding studies using GST fusion proteins XL-1 blue transformed pGEX-KG or pGEX-Gi2 were grown in the 5 ml of LB broth in the presence of ampicillin overnight, diluted to 250 ml and incubated with IPTG for 7 h. Bacterial pellets were suspended in 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitors (pepstatin 5/lg/ml, leupeptin 10/tg/ml, benzamadine hydrochloride 2 mM, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 5 mM, EDTA 3 mM, and aprotinin 50 KIU/ml). Cells were sonicated four times each for 30 s followed by addition of 0.5 ml of 10% Nonidet P(NP)-40. The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 x g at 4°C. Pellets were suspended with 5 ml of 1.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 25mM triethanolamine, lmM EDTA, pH 8.0, mixed for 10 min at 4°C and recentrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. NP-40 and CaC12 were added to the second supernatant to final concentrations of 2% and 1 mM, respectively. The first and second supernatants were combined, suspended in 50 ml PBS with protease inhibitors, added to 400 ~1 of glutathione agarose, and rotated at 4°C for 1 h. The agarose was washed five times with PBS containing 0.1% NP-40. GST-Gi2 was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (PAGE), transferred to Immobilon (Millipore) and detected by using anti-G~2 antibody (AS7, DuPont-NEN). The blot was visualized by ECL (Amersham). Nucleobindin was produced and labeled with [35S]Met by an in vitro transcription/translation system TNT kit (Promega) under the control of the T7 and T3 promoters, respectively, using pBS-Nuc. GST-Gi2 agarose containing 5/,tg of GST-Giz or GST agarose was incubated with 1 mM GDP or GTP~,S in 50 mM Tris containing 50 mM NaC1, 5 mM EDTA without Mg 2+ for 30 min at 30°C, followed by addition of 5 mM MgC12 at 4°C and washed by binding buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCI, 3 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40) with 1 mM DTT and the previously mentioned protease inhibitors. Subsequently, GST-G~2 agarose was incubated with the in vitro translated products at 4°C for 12 h, washed 5 times with binding buffer and centrifuged. The pellet was eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDSPAGE. 2.6. Coexpression of G=a and nucleobindin in COS cells COS-1 cells were transfected with pcDNA/pcDNA-G~2 or pcDNA/ pcDNA-Nuc or pcDNA-GiJpcDNA-Nuc, by the use of Lipofectamine (GIBCO). After 48 h, cells were solubilized in 20 mM Tris, 150 mM  N. Mochizuki et al./FEBS Letters 373 (1995) 155-158  pACT-Nuc pGBT9 pVA3 pLAM5' pGBT9-Gi2 pGBT9-Gq pVA3 pTD1 Fig. 1.

NaC1, 3 mM EDTA and 0.1% NP-40 with protease inhibitors, followed by 1 h incubation at 4°C. After centrifugation for 30 min at 5,000 × g, the supernatant was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon. Immunodetection was performed using the AS-7 antibody.  3. Results Screening of a human B cell c D N A library by the yeast two-hybrid system showed that four of 1.4 x 106 double transformants displayed lacZ and were His positive. The library c D N A s from 4 doubly positive colonies were purified and sequenced. Two of the four transformants had the G A L 4 activation domain followed by nucleotides that encoded a partial fragment of nucleobindin, a 461 amino acid protein isolated as a nuclear antigen in a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus [12]. The sequence downstream of the G A L 4 activation domain started from aa47 Gly in one and aa139 His in the other transformant encoding nucleobindin. We tested various combinations of control vectors and pGBT9-Gq. A filter assay for fl-galactosidase activity showed that yeast transformed with the combination of pGBT9-Gi2 and p A C T - N u c had the ability to induce the lacZ, but this was not the case for the combination of pGBT9-Gq and p A C T - N u c (Fig. 1). The G A L 4 binding domain was unable to interact with either nucleobindin, p53 in pVA3 and lamin in p L A M 5 ' also could not interact with nucleobindin, nor did pACT-G~2 itself activate the reporter gene. The above results, observed with both filter assays and liquid culture assays (Fig. 1 legend), confirmed that interactions between G~i2 and nucleobindin are specific in this two-hybrid system. In order to test the specificity of coupling of nucleobindin and G~i 2 identified in the yeast two-hybrid system, we performed in vitro binding assays using a GST-Gi2 fusion protein and nucleobindin produced by rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The GST-G~2 fusion protein, but not G S T alone, bound [35S]Met N.  Mochizuki et al. IFEBS Letters 373 (1995) 155 158  157  labelled nucleobindin. Neither G D P nor GTP~'S changed the ability of G~i2 to bind nucleobindin (Fig. 2). In order to examine possible interaction of the proteins during their expression, we transfected COS cells with the combination of pcDNA3/pcDNA-Gi2, pcDNA/pcDNA-Nuc, p c D N A - G J p c D N A - N u c , or mock/pcDNA-3. Solubilized fractions of transformants were subjected to the SDS-PAGE followed by immunodetection using anti-G~i2 antibody. The G~i2 protein expression level of the transformant produced by the combination of Gai2 and Nuc was greater than that produced by G~ 2 and mock vector (Fig. 3). 4. Discussion  Z 4+ eq  ~3  97 Although  heterotrimeric G proteins couple to seven membrane-spanning receptors and their effectors, evidence has been presented regarding linkage of such G proteins to other types of molecules. For example, a G protein can couple to the insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor [13], G~o can be associated with a nerve growth cone protein, GAP-43 [14,15], and a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein has been implicated in neural growth via interaction with a neural cell adhesion molecule and N-cadherin [16]. G=i has also been detected in organelles other than the plasma membrane (e.g. [9,17,18]). The yeast two-hybrid system allowed us to demonstrate interaction between G~i2 and the protein nucleobindin. This interaction was also observed in an in vitro binding assay and transfection with nucleobindin in COS cells increased G~i2 expression. The binding activity of G=i2 and nucleobindin did not appear to depend on guanine nucleotide, as is also noted for receptor interaction with G~ proteins [19]. Nucleobindin was originally cloned as a nuclear antigen in a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus [12,20]. Interestingly, it has a DNA-binding motif, leucine zipper, a signal peptide sequence, and an EF hand motif for Ca 2÷ binding activity [12,20~2]. Nucleobindin was independently cloned by investigators studying mineralized matrix of bovine bone and was detected in osteoid and around osteocytes of compact bone [22]. Among several tissues, the highest levels of protein were found in bone. It is intriguing that the action of several types  50 35kDa  Fig.  3. G~i2 expression of transfected COS cells. Equal amounts of solubilized extract from transfectants expressing G~i2obtained by transfection of pcDNA-G~2 alone or together with pcDNA-Nuc were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with AS7. Numbers on the left indicate molecular weight (kDa). of hormones that can influence bone formation or resorption are sensitive in inhibition by pertussis toxin (e.g. [23 26]). The ability of coexpressed nucleobindin to enhance Gc~i2expression suggests functional interaction between G~i2 and nucleobindin so as to influence transcription/translation of G~i2. Alternatively, the combination of these two-proteins may protect G~i2 from protease degradation. Whether Gcti2can influence nucleobindin expression will require further study. Previous data suggest that G proteins can exist in the cell nucleus. G proteins that can be detected by anti-G~i antibody exist in the nucleus of rat liver [t0] and M D C K cells (M. Balboa and P.A. Insel, unpublished observations). Gas has been detected in the nucleus of $49 lymphoma cells [25]. Such results suggest that G~i2 and nucleobindin may interact in the nucleus. Other data have demonstrated that heterotrimeric G proteins exist on the trans-Golgi network and can affect secretory vesicle formation [9]. Since nucleobindin has a signal peptide sequence and is secreted from murine cells, perhaps G~2 is involved in the secretion of this molecule. In summary, the current data show that use of the yeast two-hybrid system yields evidence of interaction of G=~2 and nucleobindin, a previously identified calcium binding protein and putative auto-antigen in an animal model of lupus erythematosus. It is intriguing to speculate that interaction of nucleobindin and G~2 may have physiologic importance for bone and perhaps other tissues.

																																			<Abstract>PU.1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ets family of DNA binding proteins. In this study, we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.1. Using radiolabeled PU.1 protein as a probe, we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated a number of clones encoding PU.1 interacting proteins. Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-IL6 beta, HMG I/Y, and SSRP), one clone encodes a chaperone protein, and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase. We have characterized the physical and functional interactions between PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of PU.1 disrupted PU.1-NF-IL6 beta physical interaction. This deletion disrupts the PU.1 Ets domain. Deletion of the NF-IL6 beta leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins. In transient expression assays, we found that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can functionally cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PU.1 and NF-IL6 beta can simultaneously bind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's DNA binding. These results suggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex.</Abstract>

Multiple Proteins Physically Interact with PU.1 Transcriptional Synergy with NF-ILGP (C/EBP6, CRP3)' Sujatha Nagulapalli, Jagan M. R. Pongubala,' and Michael 1 Atchison3 . PU.l is a transcription factor that belongs to the efsfamily of DNA binding proteins. In this study, we show by Far Western blot analyses that multiple nuclear proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.l. Using radiolabeled PU.l protein as a probe, we screened a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated anumber of clones encoding PU.l interacting proteins. Three of these clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-I16P, HMC and SSRP), one clone encodes a chaperone protein, and another clone encodes a multifunctional phosphatase. W e have characterized the physical and functional interactions between PU.l and NF-IL6P, a leucine zipper transcription factor implicated in inflammatory responses. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of PU.l disrupted PU.l-NF-IL6P physical interaction. This deletion disrupts the PU.l Ets domain. Deletion of the NF-IL6P leucine zipper domain also greatly diminished the interaction between these two proteins. In transient expression assays, we found that PU.l and NF-IL6P can functionally cooperate to synergisticallyactivate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that PU.l and NF-IL6P can simultaneouslybind to adjacent DNA binding sites, but apparently do not influence the kinetics or affinity of each other's D N A binding. Theseresultssuggest that transcriptional synergy is due to each protein independently influencing the basal transcription complex. Thelournal of Immunology, 1995, 155: 4330-4338.  In,  Downloaded from www.jimmunol.org on November 6, 2009  U.l is a 272-amino acid transcription factor that belongs to the ers family of DNA binding proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1). PU.l was originally cloned based on its ability to bind to MHC class I1 promoters (2) and is expressed predominantly in B cells, macrophages, and erythroid cells (2-4). This protein is important in hematopoietic development because homozygous deletion of the PU.l gene leads to loss of B cells, T cells, and macrophages (5). PU.l is identical with the gene at the mouse Spi-1 locus that was identified as the site of retroviral insertion in 95% of spleen focus-forming virus-induced murine erythroleukemias (6-10). The retroviral insertion event occurs adjacent to the PU.l gene and results in constitutive unregulated expression of the gene. Interestingly, PU.l is expressed at high levels in B cells and macrophages, but is down-regulated during erythroid differentiation (11). This down-regulation of PU.l in erythroid differentiation appears to be required for the differentiation process to proceed because overexpression of PU.l in bone marrow cells results in immortalization of erythroblasts (12). Although PU.l is clearly important in development of the hematopoietic system, little is known about factors that control its function. Previously, we demonstrated that PU.l can bind to the IgK 3' enhancer (13). Binding of PU.l to the 3' enhancer enables an additional transcription factor, NF-EMS,to bind to DNA. A Department of Animal Biology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 Received for publication May 1995. 19, 1995. Accepted for publication August 14,  P  similar protein complex composed of PU.l and NF-EM5 appears to bind to the Igh,-, enhancer (14). PU.l-NF-EM5 interaction requires that PU.l be phosphorylated on serine 148, and this interaction can influence gene expression (13, 15). PU.l function can also be influenced by the GR4 (16). Given its importance in development and the modulation of its activity in association with other proteins, it would be interesting to identify proteins that physically interact with PU.l. In the studies reported here we used radiolabeled PU.1 protein as a probe to identify proteins that physically interact with PU.l. Far Western blot analyses of nuclear extract proteins indicated the existence of multiple interacting proteins. Weused radiolabeled PU.l protein to screen a B cell cDNA expression library and isolated cDNA clones encoding proteins that physically interact with PU.l. These clones encode three DNA binding proteins, a chaperone protein, and a multifunctional phosphatase. One of the DNA binding proteins is the leucine zipper transcription factor NF-IL6P. NF-IMP is a potent trans-activator protein implicated in inflammatory responses that we show can synergistically activate transcription with PU.l. We also show that the interaction of NF-IL60 with PU.l requires PU.l carboxyl-terminal amino acids andis strongest when the NF-IL6P leucine zipper domain is intact. These results demonstrate a functional interaction between transcription factors from the e b and leucine zipper transcription factor families.

Kaelin, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). GST-NFIL6P was prepared by inserting, by blunt end ligation, an EcoRl fragment containing the entire NF-IMP coding sequence into the EcoRl site of pGEX-2TK. NF-IL6P deletion constructs 1-227, 1-151, and 1-80 were prepared by digesting the NF-IMP cDNA sequence (in pBluescript KS ') with BsgI, Norl, or Sod, respectively. The EsgI-cut plasmid was cut with BumHI, then blunted with Klenow polymerase and recircularized by blunt end ligation to yield a plasmid encoding NF-IL6P amino acids 1 to 227. The Norl- and S d - c u t plasmids were recircularized by sticky end ligation to yield plasmids encoding NF-IMP amino acids 1 to 151 or 1 to 80, respectively. To prepare plasmid 1 to 254, an EcoRl fragment containing the entire NF-IL6P cDNA sequence was cut with Pvull, and the appropriate DNA fragment was purified and cloned into the EcoRISmal sites of pBluescript KS'.. CMV-NFIL6P was prepared by inserting an EcoRI fragment containing the entire NF-IL6P coding sequence into the EcoRI site ofCMV expression plasmid CB6' (a giftfromF.Rauscher, WistarInstitute,Philadelphia,PA).

Appropriate DNA fragments were gel purified and subcloned into pCB6' cut with either EcoRI-Xhl or EcoRI-Norl.

Isopropyl I-thio-B-D-galactopyranoside added to a concentrationof 1 mM,and cells weregrownforan additional 4 h. Cells were pelleted at 5,000 X g for 5 min and resuspended in 0.1 vol NETN. After three sonication bursts on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 X g for 5 min. GST-agarosewas added, and thesamples were rocked at 4°C for 30 min. Beads were then washed three times with NETN buffer. For interaction assays, various proteins prepared by in vitrotranslation in the presence of ["S]methionine (100,O()O cpm) were added to the GST fusion proteins and incubated with rocking for 1 h at4°C. Some samples contained 5 pg/ml of oligonucleotide competitors or 50 pdml of ethidium bromide. Samples werewashedthreetimeswithNETNbuffer,resuspended in gel loading buffer, boiled, and subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.  FIGURE 1. PU.1 can physically interact with multiple proteins. A, Nuclear extract proteins isolated from S194 plasmacytoma cells were subjected to Far Western blot analysis with radiolabeled PU.1 protein. The m.w. size markers are shown to the lek. 6, The Western blot procedure was performed on either unfractionated S194 nuclear extract (lane I ) or extract fractionated by heparin agarose chromatography: the 0.2" KC1 fraction (lane 2 ) or the 0.3" KC1 fraction (lane 3 ) . The m.w. size markers are shown to the right.  Far Western procedure and library screening To detect nuclear extract proteins that interact with PU.1, 40 to 50 pg of nuclear extract proteins prepared from SI94 plasmacytoma cells by the method of Dignam et al. (20) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to Far Western blot analysis, as described by Lieberman and Berk (21). Proteins on the membranes were denatured in Far Western buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mMKCI, 6 mMMgCI,, 0.6 mM EDTA, 2 mM DIT, and 10% glycerol) with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, proteins were renatured with Far Western buffer containing 0.1 M guanidine hydrochloride and 0.02% polyvinylpyrolidine (PVP-40, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) twice for 2 h each time. After renaturation, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with BSA (50 mg/ml in Far Western buffer) for 1 h and rinsed with Far Western buffer before hybridization. "S-Labeled PU.1 protein was prepared by in vitro translation in a 50-pl rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) reaction mixture and dialyzed against Far Western buffer for 4 to 5 h at 4°C before use. Incubation was conducted using ["S]PU.I (prepared by in vitro translation) in the presence of excess cold methionine and0.1 pg/ml oligonucleotidecontaining PU.l binding the DNA site (CTITGAGGAACTGAAAACA GAACCT) at room temperature for 14 to 16 h. Blots were washed four or five times with 20 mM HEPES, 100 mMKCI, 6 mMMgCI,, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 2 mM D I T and autoradiographed. Using the same conditions, 240,000 plaque-forming units of a hgtll cDNAlibrary(human B cell leukemia RPM 4265, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were screened using 1 ml of ["sS]PU.I protein prepared by in vitro translation.  Cell culture and transfection 3T3 cells were grown in high glucose DMEM (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mM glutamine (Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin,and 0.1 mdml streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (17). Unless specified,cells were transfected with5 pg of reporter plasmid, 5 pg of effector plasmid, and 1 pg of P-galactosidaseexpression plasmid, pCHl10 (18). After 48 h, cellular extracts were prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles. CAT assays of these extracts were performed as described by Gonnan et al. (19). using P-galactosidase activity to standardize fortransfection efficiency. All transfections were performed two or three times.  EMSA EMSA was generally performed with protein products prepared by in vitro a rabbitreticulocyte translation. In vitrotranslationwasperformedwith lysate(PromegaCorp.,Madison,WI),and RNA was synthesized with either I7 or T3 polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) on linearized plasmid templates. Assay mixtures contained various in vitro translated proteins and 4000 cpm of the -3zP end-labeled oligonucleotide probes in the presence of 3.2 pg of poly(d1-dC) poly(d1-dC) in 10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCI, 1 mM DIT, 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.5. Incubation was conducted at room temperature for30 min, and electrophoresis was performed on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 0.25 X TBE (22.5 mM Tris-borate and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8). For Ab studies, 1 pI of the appropriate antiserum was added before addition of the labeled DNA probe.  Results Multiple proteins physically interact with  PU.7  Nuclear extract proteins from S194 plasmacytoma cells were subjected to the Far Western blot procedure (21). Proteins were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with JsS-labeled PU.1 protein. This analysis revealed the existence of multiple nuclear proteins capable of interacting with PU.l, including a protein of approximately 46 kDa (Fig. 1A). We previously identified a B cell-specific 46-kDa  4332 Table I.

Prcviously, we determined that NF-EMS from SI94 cell extracts KC1 elutes during heparin-agarose chromatography in the 0.2" fraction, but is lacking in the 0.3" KC1 fraction (13). Far Western blot analysis of these fractions revealed a prominent 46-kDa band in the 0.2" KC1 sample that was absent from the 0.3" KC1 sample (Fig. IB, lanes 2 and 3). Therefore, at least some of the proteins detected by the Far Western procedure are likely to be relevant to transcriptional regulation by PU.1. We reasoned that radiolabeled PU.1 protein may be a useful probe for the isolation of cDNA clones encoding proteins that physically interact with PU. 1. Given the complexity of interacting proteins revealed in Figure In, we expected that multiple distinct cDNA clones may be isolated by such a screen. Isolation of cDNA clones encoding proteins that physically interact with PU. 7  PU.1 and NF-IL6P physically interact. -"S-Labeled PU.l protein prepared by in vitro transcription and translation was assayed for interaction with either GST or GST-NFIL6P. Lanes that contain 5 pghl of either PU.1 binding site or nonspecific oligonucleotide competitors or that contain 50 pghl ethidium bromide are indicated.  Physical interaction between PU. 7 and NF-ILGP  We used the Far Western blot conditions of Lieberman and Berk (21) to screen 240,000 plaque-forming units of a human B cell leukemia cDNA expression library with "S-labeled PU.1 protein prepared by in vitro transcription and translation. Eighteen clones consistently yielded positive signals with radiolabeled PU.1 protein. Fusion proteins encoded by these clones were prepared from extracts of lysogenic bacteria. These fusion 'proteins also yielded positive signals on Far Western blots with radiolabeled PU.1 protein (data not shown). The cDNA inserts of each clone were excised from the bacteriophage vector and subcloned into plasmid vectors for DNA sequence analysis. Approximately 200 bp of DNA sequence was obtained from the ends of each clone. This analysis indicated that eight clones encoded five previously characterized proteins (Table I). Three independent clones encoded the transcription factor NF-ILhP implicated in inflammatory responses. NF-IL6P is a member of the C/EBP leucine zipper protein family and has strong transcriptional activation potential (22). This protein is ;tlso known as C/EBPS or CRP3 (23, 24). Two clones encoded hsp90, a heat shock protein with a chaperone function (25). Threeother proteins were represented by single isolates. These included HMG I/Y, SSRP, and MKP-I. HMG I/Y is an HMG domain protein (26, 27) that can influence the DNA binding of other transcription factors and can influence gene expression (28,2Y). SSRP is another HMG domain protein of unknown function. This protein was previously cloned based on its ability to bind to Ig recombination signal sequences (30) (T160) or to cisplatinmodified DNA (31). Finally, MKP-1 is a multifunctional phosphatase that is capable of dephosphorylating MAP kinase (32-34). Because of the role of NF-IL6P in inflammatory responses and the role of PU.1 in lymphoid development, we sought to characterize the interaction between these two proteins in greater detail.  To confirm the physical association between PU.1 and NF-IMP, we performed GST fusion protein chromatography experiments. The NF-IL6P cDNA sequence was subcloned into plasmid pGEX2TK to produce GST fusion construct GST-NF-IL6P. "SLabeled PU.1 protein prepared by in vitro transcription and translation was incubated with either GST or GST-NF-IL6P linked to GST agarose beads. After incubation, the beads were thoroughly washed, bound proteins were eluted by boiling, and eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. As expected, PU.l protein bound to GST-NF-IL6P, but not to GST alone (Fig. 2, lanes I and 2). This interaction was not significantly affected by inclusion of PU.1 binding site DNA sequence (lane 3), an unrelated DNA sequence (lane 4 ) , or ethidium bromide (lane 5 ) , indicating that the PU.1NF-IMP association is due to protein-protein interaction rather than protein interaction with DNA that may contaminate our mixtures. To determine whether the interaction by NF-IL6P was specific for PU.1, experiments were performed with several additional transcription factor proteins. These proteins included two Ets domain factors (Ets-2 and GABPa) aswell as GABPP. Thesefactors were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [2sS]methione (Fig. 3A) and tested for physical interaction experiments showed that with GST-NFIL6P (Fig. 3 B ) . These Ets-2, GABPcr,and GABPP interactedwith NF-IUP very poorly when compared with PU.1 (Fig. 3B, compare lunes 1-3 with lane 4 ) . Sequences required for PU. 7 and NF-IL6P interaction  Downloaded from www.jimmunol.org on November 6, 2009  PU.1 interaction with other proteins has been shown to require either the amino-terminal 7.5 amino acids or residues 119 to 160 (13, IS, 35). Therefore, it was of interest to determine the region ofPU.1 required for interaction with NF-IL6P. We prepared in vitro translated proteins from a number of PU.1 deletion mutants and tested their ability to interact with GST-NFIL6P. The mutants assayed deleted PU.1 amino acid sequences 7 to 30,33 to 100, 119 to 160, or 245 to 272 (Fig. 4A). As expected, wild-type PU.1 protein bound to GST-NFIL(,P, butnot to GST alone (Fig. 4B, Irnes 1 and 2). Assays with the PU.1 deletion mutants showed that NF-IL6P interaction with PU.1 does not require PU.1 amino acids 7 to 30 (Ianes 3 and 4 ) , 33 to 100 (lanes 5 and 6 , or 119 to 160 ) (Iane.7 7 and 8 ) . However, deletion of the PU.l carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids (residues 245-272) reduced the interaction with NF-IL6P dramatically (Ianes 9 and 10). This deletion disrupts the PU.1 Ets domain, which spans amino acids 167 to 255 and constitutes its DNA binding domain. In a reciprocal assay, "S-labeled NF-IL6P was prepared byin vitro transcription and translation,  The Journal of Immunology  4333  A In vitro translation product  A PEST  n PU.lA7-30 PU.lA33-100 PU.lA119-160 PU.lA245272  Domain  4  ) )  (  ETS Domain  B 2 3 4  Downloaded from www.jimmunol.org on November 6, 2009   m  4  _. 4567  8 9 1 0 11 12 FIGURE 4.

The identity o each transcription factor is shown above the lanes.  and mixed with a GST-PU.1 fusion protein. As expected, the labeled NF-IMP bound to GST-PU.1, but not to GST alone (Fig. 4B, lanes I 1 and 12). To identify sequences within NF-IL6P necessary for interaction with PU.1, we prepared a series of progressive carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of NF-IL6P (Fig. 5 A ) . These mutants contained sequences 1 to 254, 1 to 227, 1 to 151, or 1 to 80. The 1 to 254 mutant contains the intact NF-IL6P leucine zipper domain, whereas the 1 to 227 mutant deletes four of the five leucines in the zipper region. One would, therefore, expect that the wild-type and the 1 to 254 mutant should be capable of binding to an NF-IL6P DNA binding site, whereas the other mutants should be incapable of binding to DNA. To confirm this prediction, each protein was prepared by in vitro transcription and translation, and subjected to EMSA. As expected, only the wild-type and 1 to 254 mutant bound to the DNA probe (Fig. 5B). Equal synthesis of each mutant protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Equal counts of each protein were incubated with GST-PU. I . The wildtype NF-IL6P protein and the 1 to 254 mutant yielded comparable binding to GST-PU.1 (Fig. 5C, lanes 1-4). However, deletion of an additional 27 amino acids to position 227 (which removes four of five of the leucines in the zipper region) greatly reduced the physical interaction (lanes 5 and 6). Deletion to residues 15 1 or 80 also resulted in proteins with reduced binding to PU.1 (lanes 7-10), although physical interaction was not completely abolished. Therefore, sequences amino-terminal to the NF-IL6P leucine zipper can provide weak interaction with PU.1. However, maximal  interaction occurs when the NF-IL6P leucine zipper and the PU.1 Ets domains are intact. PU. 1 and NF-ILGP synergistically activate transcription  Because PU.1 and NF-IL6P physically interact with each other, we sought to determine whether they could synergistically activate transcription. PU.1 and NF-IL6P were cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pCB6+, which drives expression of the cloned sequences from the CMV promoter to yield plasmids CMV-PU. 1 and CMV-NF-IL6P, respectively. These expression plasmids were transfected into 3T3 cells in the presence of various reporter plasmids. Initially, we assayed a reporter plasmid containing a single copy of the PU.1 binding site adjacent to an NF-IL6P binding site (13, 36). This oligonucleotide was cloned adjacent to the LBK promoter, driving expression of the CAT gene (PU-IMP);,LBKCAT. Co-transfection of this reporter plasmid with CMV-PU. 1 resulted in no incrcase in CAT activity (Fig. 6A, compare lanes I and 3). This was not unexpected,becausetranscriptionalactivationfrom PU.1 binding sites usually requires that thesite be presentin multiple copies (our unpublished observations). Co-transfection with CMV-NF-IMP induced a significant activation ofexpression (Fig. hA, lane 2).

Thus, although PU.l had no effect by itself, i t stimulated expression synergistically in the presence of NF-IUP. To determine whether the synergism be tween  PU.1 and NF-IMP could be optimized by altering the distance between their binding sites, we also tested three other reporter plasmids containing different spacing o f the PU.l and NF-IL6P binding sites (2, 4, and 12 bp further apart). In all cases, cotransfection o f CMV-PU.1 and CMV-NF-IMP resulted in two- to threefold synergy in transcriptional activity (data from the 12-bp insertion, (PU-IUP)bLBKCAT, are shown in lunes 5-8). To determine whether NF-IMP might recruit PU.1 to the promoter by protein-protein interaction in the absence o f PU.1 DNA binding sequences, we prepared a reporter construct containing a single NF-IUP binding site, (1MP)LBKCAT. CMV-PU.1 alone  The Journal of Immunology did not activate this reporter construct (Fig. 6A, lune 1I), whereas activation by CMV-NF-IMP was clearly observed (lune 10). Cotransfection of CMV-PU.1 plus CMV-NF-IMP did not result in synergy of transcriptional activity (lane 12). Therefore, it appears that NF-IL6P cannot recruit PU.1 to the promoter region in the absence of PU.l DNA binding sequences. We also performed experiments with a reporter construct containing four copiesof the PU.1 binding site, (PU.1)LBKCAT. This construct was activated by NF-IL6P as well as PU.1 (Fig. 6A, lunes 13-15). Activation by NF-IMP appears to be due to the presence of NF-IMP binding sequences within the LBK promoter because identical activation was observed with the parent LBK CAT reporter plasmid (data not shown). Co-transfection of CMVPU.l and CMV-NFIMP again resulted in significant transcriptional synergy (lune 16). To determine whether the activation of (PU.l)LBKCAT by NF-IL6P required that NF-IL6P bind to the reporter construct, we performed transfections with two NF-IMP deletion mutants incapable of binding to DNA (mutants 1-227 and 1-151). Whereas the wild-type NF-IL6P protein activated expression and synergized with PU.l (Fig. 6B, lunes 1-4), the deletion mutants failed to increase expression (Fig. 6B, compare lane 2 with lunes 5 and 6 ) and were incapable of synergizing with PU.1 (Fig. 6B, lunes 7 and 8. ) The above results indicate the PU.l and NF-IL6P can cooperate to synergistically activate transcription. This synergism requires that PU.1and NF-IL6P binding sites be present on the reporter construct. The mechanism of synergism could be related to each transcription factor independently influencing some aspect of the transcription reaction. Alternatively, the synergism could be due to cooperative DNA binding of PU.l and NF-IMP totheir respective binding sites when both proteins are present. Therefore, we examined certain parameters of PU.l and NF-IMP binding to DNA.

PU.1 and NF-IMP proteins prepared by in vitro transcription and translation each bound individually to this probe (Fig. 7A, lunes I and 2). A mixture of both proteins yielded the complexes characteristic of PU.1 or NF-IL6P binding as well as an additional complex of slower mobility (Fig. 7A, lune 3 ) .To determine whether this third complex contains both PU.1 and NF-IL6P bound to the probe, we performed competition studies with unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors. A PU.1 binding site competitor abolished the PU.1 complex as well as the third complex (lune 4 ) . Similarly, an NF-IMP competitor abolished the third complex in addition to the NF-IMP complex (lune 5). In the same way, inclusion of NF-IL6P antiserum resulted in a supershift of the NF-IL6P complex and the third complex, whereas preimmune or anti-YY1 serum had no effect (Fig. 7B). The above data indicate that PU.l and NF-IL6P can simultaneously bind to the oligonucleotide probe. However, the relatively low intensity of the third complex compared with that of each protein binding alone is not indicative of cooperative binding.  Y. . " a  +PU.l  123456  C  FIGURE 7 PU.l and NF-IL6P binding to DNA.PU.l-NFIL6P oligo.  nucleotide 2 (see Materials andMethods) was subjected to EMSA with PU.l and NF-IL6P prepared by in vitro translation. The identity the of proteins in each assay is shown above the lanes. Lanes 4 and 5 in A contain 100 ng of PU.l oligonucleotide 4 or NF-IL6P oligonucleotide 3, respectively. Lanes 4-6 in B contain 1 FI of preimmune, anti-NFIL6P, or anti-YY1 antiserum, respectively. In C, EMSA was performed with either NF-IL6P alone (lanes 7-5)or with PU.l (lanes 6-70). The nanograms of unlabeled NF-IL6P competitor oligonucleotide 3 added  12345678910  to each assay is indicated above the lanes. In all panels, arrows at the right identify complexes corresponding to PU.l, NF-IL6P,PU.1plus  NF-IL6P, or Ab supershifted complexes.  4336 To determine whether PU.l and NF-IL6P bound to DNA with higher affinity when present together, EMSA was performed with the PU.I-NFIL6P oligonucleotide probe using NF-IL6P, either alone or in the presence of PU.l (Fig. 7C). Sampleswereleft either untreated (lanes I and 6) or were incubated with increasing quantities ofan unlabeled NF-IL6P competitor oligonucleotide (compare lanes 2-5 with lanes 7-10). These studies showed that the PU.1 plus NF-IL6P complex did not bind to DNA with higher affinity compared with that of NF-IL6P alone. The same experiment was performed with oligonucleotides containing the binding sites with different spacings. Identical results were obtained (data not shown). Equilibrium binding studies and off-rate experiments also failed to detect any change in the kinetics of NF-IL6P binding to DNA in the presence of PU.l (data not shown). Our results indicate that each protein binds to DNA with similar properties, either alone or in the presence of the other protein. Therefore, the transcriptional synergism between PU.l and NF-IL6Pdoes not appear to be due to cooperative binding to DNA, to altered affinity for DNA, or to increased stability of the protein-DNA complex. Instead, synergism is most likely due to each protein independently influencing components of the basal transcription complex.  PU.l INTERACTING PROTEINS  Discussion We have identified proteins that interact with the B cell, macrophage, and erythroid-specific transcription factor, PU.1. Far Western blot analyses with radiolabeled PU.l protein indicated that multiple B cell nuclear extract proteins are capable of physically interacting with PU.l (Fig. 1). Consistent with this observation, our screen of a B cell lymphoma cDNA expression library with radiolabeled PU.l protein resulted in the isolation of a number of interesting proteins. Our isolated clones encode DNA binding proteins (NF-IL6P, HMG I/Y, and SSRP), a chaperone protein (hspYO), and a phosphatase (MKP-1). The role ofhspY0 in gene regulation with PU.l is unclear. However, it is known that hsp90 can influence the activity of other transcription factors. For instance, hspY0 can interact with the helix-loop-helix protein MyoDl and convert it to an active form, as assayed by DNA binding (37). In a similar fashion, hsp90 may interact with PU.l and contribute to its ability to bind to DNA by assisting in the formation of an active protein conformation. HMG I/Y and SSRP are both HMG domain proteins. Similar to hsp90, HMG I/Y can assist in the binding of certain proteins to DNA. HMG I / Y interacts with NF-KBand ATF-2 to increase their abilities to bind to the IFN-/3 promoter (28, 29). These interactions appear to be important for induction of IFN-P gene expression in response to viral induction (29). The role of SSRP in gene regulation is presently unknown. Further experiments will be necessary to determine the mechanism of PU.1 interaction with these proteins, their influence on PU.l DNA binding, and their potential role in controlling transcription. The phosphatase MKP-1 is also a very interesting protein. The substrate for this phosphatase appears to be MAP kinase (33, 34, 38). MKP-1 dephosphorylates the threonine and tyrosine residues of MAP kinase that are phosphorylated in the cellular growth response, leading to inactivation of MAP kinase and inhibition of the growth signal. An interesting possibility is that PU.l and M U - I carry out antagonistic functions within the cell. We have focused our efforts here on the interaction between PU.1and the transcription factor NF-IL6P. The apparent mouse homologue of human NF-IL6P is variously named CiEBP8 or CRP3 (23, 24), although the 15% divergence (41 of 269 amino acids) between the human and the murine form makes it unclear whether they are truly orthologous genes. NF-IL6P is a leucine  zipper transcription factor that belongs to the C/EBP family of proteins. Other members of this family include C/EBP (C/EBPcr) (39, 40), CIEBPP (NF-IL6, LAP, IL6-DBP, AGP-DBP, and CRP2) (24, 41-45), CiEBPy (IglEBP) (23, 46), and CRPl (24). Cooper et al. (47) observed that CRP3 (the apparent murine homologue of NF-IL6P) is expressed atvery low levels at all stages of B cell development. Others have also noted that NF-IL6P is present in very low quantities in most cell types, but can be induced in many cells by treatment of animals with bacterial LPS (22). Therefore, NF-IL6P may play a role in certain inflammatory responses. Whether NF-IL6P cooperates with PU.1 in this process is presently unclear. The combined roles of PU.l and NF-IL6P in naturally occurring promoters have not been studied to date. However, potential PU.1 and NF-IMP sites are present in some naturally occurring promoters, including the 1L6 and RANTES gene promoters (48, 49). These genes are responsive to a number of signaling pathways or to inflammatory agents in a variety of tissues, including those that express PU.l. It will be interesting to determine whether the above genes can be regulated by PU.1 and NF-IL6P. Gene knock-out studies have indicated that PU.l is important for development of B cells, T cells, and macrophages ( 5 ) . Similarly, members of the C/EBP family of leucine zipper proteins play important roles in adipocyte and macrophage cellular differentiation (23,50-52). Homozygous mutation of the NF-IL6 gene leads to mice deficient in macrophage bactericidal and tumoricidal activities (53). The C/EBP gene family also appears to be important for regulation of immune response and inflammatory responsive genes, because many of these genes contain adjacent binding sites for NF-IL6 factors and NF-KB. NF-IL6 transcription factors are known to physically interact with NF-KB, the GR, and jun-fos via the NF-IL6 leucine zipper domain (54-58). This is the first report, however, of NF-IL6P interaction with an Ets domain protein ( i c , PU.1). Our deletion studies with NF-IL6P indicated that, similar to interaction with other proteins, maximal interaction with PU.l requires an intact leucine zipper region. Before this report, PU.l was known to physically interact with several proteins. These included TBP, Rb, and NF-EM5 (13, 1.5, 35). A cDNA clone encoding a protein with properties similar to those of NF-EMS was recently cloned (59). Functional studies also suggested an interaction between PU.l and the GR (16). The region of PU.l responsible for these interactions differs depending upon the protein partner. Whereas TBP, Rb, andGR appear to interact with amino-terminal PU.1 sequences, NF-EM5 interacts with more centrally located sequences within the PU.1 PEST domain. Interestingly, serine 148 within this region must be phosphorylated for PU.l to physically interact with NF-EM5 (15). None of these PU.l sequences is required for PU.l interaction with NF-IMP. Our GST-fusion protein experiments indicated that deletion of the PEST domain or the amino-terminal region of PU.l had no effect on PU.1-NF-IL6P physical interaction. However, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 28 amino acids of PU.1 caused a dramatic loss of interaction with NF-IL6P. This deletion disrupts the carboxyl-terminal portion of the PU.1 Ets domain. From our studies we cannot determine whether reduced protein interaction is due to loss of Ets domain sequences or to loss of the carboxylterminal sequences outside of the Ets domain. However, it is clear that the segment of PU.l necessary for interaction with NF-IL6P is different fromthat necessary for interaction with NF-EMS, TBP, Rb, or GR. In summary, maximal interaction between PU.l and NF1Up requires PU.1 carboxyl-terminal sequences (potentially overlapping the Ets domain) and NF-IL6P leucine zipper sequences. Our transfection experiments indicated that PU.l and NF-IL6P can synergistically cooperate to activate transcription.

PU.1 and NF-ILhP cansimultaneously bind to DNA to yield a complex containing both proteins, this simultaneous binding did not appreciably alter the kinetics or affinity of protein-DNA interactions. Instead, the transcriptional synergy that we observed may be the result of each protein independentlyinfluencing components of thebasal transcription complex. Because maximal interaction between PU.l and NF-IL6P requires sequences near their DNA binding domains, it is possible that their physical association can inhibit DNA binding by either protein. However, we have not observed an inhibitory effect of either protein on DNA binding (data not shown) or transactivation (Fig. 6A). However, it is still possible that in surne contexts, the physical interaction between PU.1 and NF-IL6P may inhibit the function of either protein. The transcriptional synergythat we observed between PU.1 and NF-ILhP suggests that some promoters or enhancers may be regulated by interactions between Ets and leucine zipper proteins.It is interesting to note that the junB promoter contains an Ets-binding sequence adjacent to a CRE-like sequence. These sequences bind to Ets domain and leucine zipper proteins, respectively (60). Similarly, the lgrc 3' enhancer contains a CRE-like sequence adjacent to the PU.l binding site. This CRE-like sequence also binds to leucine zipper proteins, and these proteins can physically interact with PU.1 (61). In addition, Ets-2 appears to form a ternary complex with c-jun and junB on the macrophage scavenger receptor genepromoter (62). Ets-2canalsofunctionallycooperatewith Myh to activate the mim-1 gene promoter (63). Thus, interactions between Ets and leucine zipper proteins may be a common mechanism for controlling gene expression, especially withintheimmune system.

																																				<Abstract>We have previously shown that soluble partially degraded fibrin(ogen) remains in solution after fibrin clot formation and is a potent fibroblast mitogen (Gray, A.J., Bishop, J.E., Reeves J.T., Mecham, R.P., and Laurent, G.J. (1995) Am. J. Cell Mol. Biol. 12, 684-690). Mitogenic sites within the fibrin(ogen) molecule are located on the A alpha and B beta chains of the protein (Gray, A.J., Bishop, J. E., Reeves, J.T., and Laurent, G.J. (1993) J. Cell Sci. 104, 409-413). However, receptor pathways through which mitogenic effects are mediated are unknown. The present study sought to determine the nature of fibrin(ogen) receptors expressed on human fibroblasts which interact with the fibrinogen B beta chain. Receptor complexes were isolated from 125I-surface-labeled fibroblasts and purified on a fibrinogen B beta chain affinity column. Subsequent high performance liquid chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated fibrinogen B beta chain bound specifically to a 60-kDa surface protein. Sequence analysis of the amino terminus of this protein indicated 100% homology to human calreticulin. Immunoprecipitation experiments employing a polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibody provided further evidence that the 60-kDa protein isolated in this study was calreticulin. Further, polyclonal antibodies to human calreticulin significantly inhibited the mitogenic activity of fibrinogen B beta chain on human fibroblasts. The present study has shown that cell surface calreticulin binds to the B beta chain of fibrinogen mediating its mitogenic activity.</Abstract>

The analysis of complexes of A beta with CSF proteins in a KBr gradient revealed an association of A beta only with free proteins and not with lipoprotein particles.

																																				<Abstract>The proximal sequence element (PSE)-binding transcription factor (PTF) specifically recognizes the PSEs of both RNA polymerase II- and RNA polymerase III-transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTF alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTF gamma and PTF delta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the four PTF subunits originally found to copurify during conventional chromatography indeed form a tightly associated complex; they further show that the PTF so defined, including the gamma and delta subunits specifically, is essential for transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes. Immunoprecipitation assays also show a weak substoichiometric association of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with PTF, consistent with the previous report of a PTF-related complex (SNAPc) containing substoichiometric levels of TBP and a component (SNAPc43) identical in sequence to the PTF gamma reported here. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays further indicate relatively strong direct interactions of both recombinant PTF gamma and PTF delta with TBP, consistent either with the natural association of TBP with PTF in a semistable TBP-TBP-associated factor complex or with possible functional interactions between PSE-bound PTF and TATA-bound TBP during promoter activation. In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes.</Abstract>

We previously have shown that PTF purified from human HeLa cells is a multisubunit complex of four polypeptides designated PTFalpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta. We now report the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding PTFgamma and PTFdelta, as well as functional studies with cognate antibodies that recognize the native PTF complex in HeLa extracts.

In addition, we show that in extracts depleted of TBP and TBP-associated factors, transcription from the U1 promoter is restored by recombinant TBP but not by TFIID or TFIIIB, indicating that transcription of class II snRNA genes requires a TBP complex different from the one used for mRNA-encoding genes. In the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, DNA-dependent RNA polymerases I, II, and III (pol I, pol II, and pol III) direct transcription of different classes (I, II, and III) of genes with distinct promoter structures. Each RNA polymerase recognizes its target promoters via protein-protein interactions with a largely distinct set of basal transcription factors bound to core promoter elements. However, just as several factors binding to upstream regulatory elements have been implicated in transcription from more than one class of genes, so it also has been shown that a key component of the basal transcription factors is required for transcription by all three RNA polymerases (reviewed in references 11 and 16). Thus, the TATAbinding protein (TBP) participates in transcription by all three RNA polymerases by tightly associating with distinct groups of TBP-associated factors (TAFs) to form SL1, TFIID, and TFIIIB (6, 7, 10, 19, 20, 28, 37, 40, 44, 48), which are critical for transcription by pol I, pol II, and pol III, respectively. Mammalian small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes contain similar promoter structures, but some (class II) are transcribed by pol II whereas others (class III) are transcribed by pol III (reviewed in references 8, 15, 24, 31, and 34). This finding poses the interesting question as to how specific RNA polymerases are selected for transcription of the different classes of snRNA genes. Both classes of snRNA genes contain a distal sequence element (DSE) and a proximal sequence element (PSE) located near positions -220 and -60, respectively, rel* Corresponding author.

The DSE functions as an enhancer and is required for maximal transcription, whereas the PSE is essential for transcription and in class II snRNA genes localizes the transcription start site. The DSE and PSE are functionally interchangeable between the two classes of snRNA genes (26, 30, 33), indicating that the PSE per se is not responsible for polymerase selection. The major difference between promoters of the two classes is the presence of a TATA box at -25 only in class III snRNA genes. Interestingly, while the TATA box (e.g., adenovirus major late promoter) or the PSE (e.g., U1) can separately support pol II transcription, the combination of both elements determines pol III specificity in class III snRNA genes (e.g., U6) (25, 26, 30). PSE-binding activities have been independently identified and characterized by several laboratories (22, 32, 36, 41). We earlier showed that the PSE is specifically recognized by the PSE-binding transcription factor (PTF) and that binding of PTF to the PSE is increased by Oct-1 bound to an adjacent octamer site (32). More recently we purified PTF to near homogeneity from HeLa cell extracts and showed that it activates transcription from both classes of snRNA genes in a PSE-dependent manner (46). Biochemical analyses demonstrated that human PTF is a stable complex of four polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 180, 55, 45, and 44 kDa, which are called PTFalpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta, respectively. In addition, UV cross-linking experiments indicated that PTFalpha is the major DNA-binding subunit of the complex. In addition to PTF, PSE-binding activities called PSE-binding protein (PBP) and snRNA-activating protein complex (SNAPc) have been  2  YOON ET AL.  MOL. CELL. BIOL. incubated for 20 min at 30C.

Transcription reactions from the pU1*G-, pU2*G-, and pU2*ABCG- templates were performed in a final volume of 25 mul containing 11 mul of HeLa nuclear extract, 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 5.0 mM dithiothreitol, 1.0 mM 3'-O-methyl GTP, 500 muM ATP, 500 muM CTP, 0.26 muM [alpha-32P]UTP (20 muCi), 2.0 U of RNase T1, and 1.0 mug of a supercoiled template. Transcription proceeded for 1 h at 30C, and RNA products were extracted and analyzed as described above. Immunoprecipitation of PTF and TBP. Anti-PTFdelta antibodies were purified from rabbit sera by using protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) as described previously (13). Antibodies (2 mg of protein per ml of resin) were cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose by incubation with dimethyl pimelimidate (20 mM in 0.2 M sodium borate [pH 9.0]) for 30 min. After the residual active groups were blocked by 0.2 M ethanolamine, the non-cross-linked immunoglobulins were removed by washing the resin in 0.2 M glycine (pH 2.5). In the experiments shown in Fig. 5, 30 mul of antibody-coupled resin was incubated for 2 h at 4C with 400 mul of nuclear extract in buffer BC (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 20% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.03% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol) containing either 100 (BC100) or 400 (BC400) mM KCl. After the resin was washed five times with the same buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with 60 mul of 0.2 M glycine (pH 2.5). For immunoprecipitation of TBP, 400 mul of nuclear extract prepared from HeLa cells constitutively expressing the FLAG-tagged TBP (6) was incubated for 6 h at 4C with 20 mul of the anti-FLAG M2­agarose (IBI/Kodak). After the beads were washed five times in BC100, the bound proteins were eluted twice by incubation at 4C for 20 min each time with 30 mul of BC100 containing 0.2 mg of the FLAG peptide per ml. Eluted proteins were pooled, and aliquots were analyzed by immunoblotting. Protein-protein interaction assays. Glutathione S-transferase (GST), GSTTBP, GST-N terminus of TBP (residues 1 to 163; GST-TBPN), and GST-TBP core domain (residues 154 to 335; GST-TBPC) fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli (18) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose. Labeled FLAG-tagged PTFgamma and PTFdelta were produced by coupled in vitro transcription-translation in the presence of [35S]methionine as described by the manufacturer (Promega). GST and GST fusion proteins (1 mug bound to 5 mul of glutathione-Sepharose resin) were incubated with 5 mul of translated FLAG-PTFgamma and FLAG-PTFdelta in 100 mul of BC100 or BC400 for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with the same buffer, bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by fluorography. Immunodepletion of PTF and TBP from HeLa nuclear extracts. To deplete PTF, 300 mul of anti-PTFdelta antiserum was incubated with 100 mul of protein A-Sepharose (Oncogene Science) for 2 h at 4C with constant mixing. After three washes with BC100 and three washes with BC400, the resin was incubated for 2 h with 400 mul of HeLa nuclear extract adjusted to 400 mM KCl. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated for 1 h with 50 mul of protein A-Sepharose beads to remove residual immunoglobulins. The supernatant was dialyzed against BC100, and aliquots were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The procedure for immunodepletion of TBP was essentially the same except that nuclear extract was incubated twice with anti-TBP antibody-coated protein A-Sepharose resin.  implicated in transcription of class II and class III snRNA genes (4, 36, 41). Interestingly, SNAPc has been reported to be a TBP-TAF complex distinct from SL1, TFIID, and TFIIIB (36). However, our own studies have implicated a 90-kDa subunit (TFIIIB90) of human TFIIIB in transcription of snRNA genes by pol III, although it appears to function in a complex different from the TBP-containing TFIIIB complex involved in transcription of 5S, VAI, and tRNA genes by pol III (42). Hence, the exact involvement of TBP and associated or interacting factors in snRNA transcription remains an important question. PTF is likely to play a key role in snRNA gene transcription by interacting with transcription factors bound to snRNA enhancers and by communicating directly with both class II and class III general transcription factors. To further study the mechanism of snRNA gene transcription, we have undertaken molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding PTF subunits. Here we report the cloning and characterization of PTFgamma and PTFdelta cDNAs. MATERIALS AND METHODS HeLa cells and extracts. HeLa cells were maintained in Joklik minimal essential medium containing 5% bovine calf serum. Nuclear extracts and cytosolic S100 extracts were prepared as described previously (9). Extracts for U1 and U2 transcription were prepared with a modification described by Bernues et al. (4). Plasmids. O+P+ and O+P- 7SK maxigene templates have been described previously (32). The templates pU1*G-, pU2*G-, and pU2*ABCG- (a generous gift from N. Hernandez) have been described by Sadowski et al. (36). Cloning of cDNAs encoding PTF subunits. PTF was purified as described previously (46). Purified PTF was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and resolved polypeptides were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon; Millipore). Polypeptide bands corresponding to PTF subunits were excised and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C. After separation of derived peptides by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), amino acids sequences for several peptides from each PTF subunit were determined at the Rockefeller University protein sequencing facility. Degenerate PCR primers were then designed on the basis of peptide sequences presented in Fig. 1. Nested PCR was performed to clone PTFgamma and PTFdelta cDNAs directly from a human Namalwa cDNA library, which was used as the template. The outer primers for PTFgamma were TTYCARCARGAYYTIGTIAAYG and TTCATRTTYTGRTAR TCRTGIAC. The first-round PCR product was then used as the template for the second-round PCR, for which the inner primers were CARCAYTTYGAYGCI GCITAYA and TCRTGIACRTTIARCATYTCYTC. For PTFdelta, the outer primers were CAYCCIGGIGGNCTNCARGG and ATYTCIGGIGCNGGRTCY TC, and the inner primers were GARGCICARCCICCNGCNCC and GGRTC YTCYTGICCICCNGG. PCR products were subsequently used to screen human Namalwa cDNA libraries (1). Final positive phages were excised in vivo and transferred into pBluescript SK (Stratagene) as instructed by the manufacturer and identified by double-stranded DNA sequencing with Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical). The nucleotide sequence of the clones was determined on both strands by synthesizing internal sequencing primers. Antigen and antiserum preparation. To produce recombinant proteins used as antigens, cDNAs encoding PTFgamma and PTFdelta were subcloned into pRSET (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) containing pLysS (39). After induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), proteins were purified by nitrilotriacetic acid-resin affinity chromatography (17) and subsequently by electroelution following SDS-PAGE. New Zealand White rabbits (3 kg) initially were injected intradermally with 300 mug of antigen emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant. Rabbits were boosted subcutaneously every 4 weeks with 100 mug of antigen emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Blood was collected from dorsal ear veins 10 days after each boost. Preparation of antisera against PTFalpha and PTFbeta will be published elsewhere (2, 45). EMSA. The probe for electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) was prepared by end labeling the HindIII restriction fragment of O+P+ with the Klenow enzyme and [alpha-32P]dATP. Double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors had the following sequences: wild-type mouse U6 PSE, ACAAAAGGAAACT CACCCTAACTGTAAAGTAATTGTGTGTT; and mutant mouse U6 PSE, AC AAAAGGAAACTAAGATCTGCTGTAAAGTAATTGTGTGTT. Twenty femtomoles of probe was used in a 20-mul reaction mixture containing 4% Ficoll type 400, 20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) KOH (pH 7.9), 70 to 80 mM KCl, 1 mM spermidine, 100 mug of bovine serum albumin per ml, 0.03% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 mug of poly(dIdC). Reactions were initiated by the addition of protein, and mixtures were  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  RESULTS Cloning of cDNAs encoding PTF subunits. PTF was purified from HeLa S100 extracts (5 liters, 100 g of protein) as described previously (46), and individual polypeptides were transferred to a membrane after separation by SDS-PAGE. Major polypeptides corresponding to the four PTF subunits were subjected to peptide microsequencing analysis. Peptide sequences derived from PTFgamma and PTFdelta were subsequently  VOL. 16, 1996  CLONING OF HUMAN PSE-BINDING FACTOR PTF  3  used to design degenerate primers for PCR amplification, and derived PCR products were used as probes to screen human cDNA libraries for corresponding cDNAs. Nucleotide sequences of the longest cDNA clones for PTFgamma (lambda12-1) and PTFdelta (lambda23-2) indicated that PTFgamma and PTFdelta cDNAs encoded open reading frames of 368 and 334 amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 43 and 36 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1). The putative translation initiation codons were assigned to the first ATGs of each clone, which closely match the Kozak consensus sequence (23). The deduced protein sequences contain all PTFgamma and PTFdelta peptide sequences that were obtained by microsequencing. The predicted amino acid sequence of PTFgamma indicates that it is a highly charged (36% of total amino acids) and overall basic protein with an isoelectric point of 9.5. The hydropathy profile of PTFgamma shows a high degree of hydrophilicity in the carboxyterminal half of the protein, reflecting the more frequent occurrence of charged amino acids (data not shown). Secondary structure plots predict that PTFgamma has a predominantly alpha-helical structure. Interestingly, the amino-terminal region of PTFgamma has a substantial aromatic amino acid content, with 20 phenylalanines and tyrosines in the first 150 amino acids. Its significance is not known. The deduced amino acid sequence of PTFdelta shows that it is both acidic (pI of 5.7) and rich in proline (13.8% of all residues). The region between residues 141 and 196 is especially proline rich (26.6%). Plots predicting protein secondary structure show potential turns in the proline-rich region (data not shown). Protein database searches scored sequence similarities of this region to other proline-rich proteins, including the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA pol II. Antibodies raised against recombinant PTF subunits recognize native PTF. To facilitate the analysis of various functions of PTF in transcription, rabbit antisera were prepared against portions of PTFgamma and PTFdelta expressed in bacteria. Both antiPTFgamma and anti-PTFdelta antibodies reacted strongly with protein bands of 45 and 44 kDa, respectively, in purified PTF (data not shown) and in HeLa nuclear extracts (see Fig. 6B) via immunoblotting assays. Since the calculated molecular mass of PTFdelta (36 kDa) is substantially smaller than its apparent size (43 to 44 kDa) in the purified PTF, the cDNA encoding PTFdelta was transcribed and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, and the mobility of the translated protein in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel was compared with that of the native protein in the HeLa nuclear extract by immunoblot analysis. Recombinant PTFdelta as well as recombinant PTFgamma had the same mobilities as their natural counterparts (data not shown), indicating that the cDNA clones encode full-length PTFgamma and PTFdelta subunits. To examine whether natural equivalents of the cloned proteins were present in the specific PTF-PSE complex, the effect of the anti-recombinant PTF subunit antibodies on the protein-DNA complex was monitored by an Oct-1­PTF supershift assay. As shown in Fig. 2, incubation of PTF and Oct-1 with a probe containing both the 7SK PSE and an adjacent octamer element resulted in an Oct-1­PTF­DNA supershift complex in addition to an Oct-1­DNA complex (lane 4). The supershift complex, but not the Oct-1­DNA complex, was greatly reduced by competition with an excess of an oligonucleotide containing the wild-type mouse U6 PSE but not with one containing the mutant site (lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the formation of the supershift complex is dependent on the presence of the PSE. When immune serum against Oct-1 was added to the reaction, both Oct-1­DNA and Oct-1­PTF­DNA complexes were abolished and an antibody-dependent supershift complex specific to the immune serum (lanes 7 and 8) appeared on top of the gel, confirming that both complexes  contained Oct-1. Addition of anti-PTFgamma (lane 10) or anti-PTFdelta (lane 12) antiserum to the reaction supershifted the Oct-1­ PTF­DNA complex but did not affect the Oct-1­DNA complex. In addition to the supershifted complex (which was more readily apparent in a longer autoradiographic exposure; data not shown), anti-PTFdelta antibodies generated a band with a mobility slightly greater than that of the Oct-1­PTF­DNA complex (lane 12). It is possible that this represents a complex lacking the PTFdelta subunit as a result of its removal by the antibodies. Addition of preimmune sera did not affect the protein-DNA complexes (lanes 9 and 11). These results demonstrate that the cloned proteins represent subunits of the native PTF and that the anti-PTF antibodies can recognize PTF in solution and are suitable for functional studies. PTF is required for transcription from both class II and class III snRNA genes. To investigate the requirement of PTF for transcription from both pol II- and pol III-transcribed snRNA genes, HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated with antiPTFdelta preimmune or immune serum to remove endogenous PTF. The immunoblotting analysis in Fig. 3A shows that PTFdelta was efficiently depleted by the immune serum but not by the preimmune serum. Other PTF subunits were also efficiently and specifically removed by anti-PTFdelta antibodies, suggesting that PTF subunits exist as a stable complex in solution (data not shown; see Fig. 6B). Immunodepletion of PTFdelta greatly reduced the level of transcription from the 7SK gene but did not affect the transcription from the adenovirus VAI gene used as a control pol III promoter (lanes 1 and 3). Addition of increasing amounts of highly purified PTF activated transcription from the 7SK gene in a dose-dependent manner without affecting VAI gene transcription (lanes 5 to 7). Transcriptional activation by PTF was dependent on the intact PSE site, since a template with a PSE mutation that eliminates PTF binding (32) was inactive both in the mock-depleted extract (lane 2) and in the exogenous PTF-dependent assay (lane 8). We next examined the effect of PTF depletion on the transcription of pol II-dependent snRNA genes in nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig. 4, removal of PTFdelta inhibited transcription from both U1 and U2 snRNA promoters (lanes 2 and 8). U1 and U2 transcription was restored in a dose-dependent manner by addition of purified PTF to depleted extracts (lanes 3 to 5 and 10) and was dependent on an intact PSE (lanes 10 and 11). Transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter control was not affected by the depletion or readdition of PTF (data not shown). These results indicate that PTF is required for the transcription of both pol II- and pol III-dependent snRNA genes. Similar immunodepletion studies with anti-PTFgamma antibodies generated results which paralleled those observed with antiPTFdelta antibodies. The antibodies coprecipitated other PTF subunits and specifically impaired transcription from both the 7SK and U1 genes (data not shown). In an effort to assign gene-specific functions to each PTF subunit, purified antibodies against PTFgamma and PTFdelta were directly added to transcription reactions for both pol II- and pol III-dependent snRNA genes. However, addition of antibodies failed to reveal any differential roles for the various subunits in transcription, since anti-PTFgamma antibodies specifically impaired transcription of both class II and class III snRNA genes whereas anti-PTFdelta antibodies had no effect on transcription of either class (data not shown). The latter result does not contradict the results presented above, since the immunoreactive PTF complexes were not removed from the reaction. Interaction of PTF with TBP.

Unlabeled competitors (compet.; 50-fold molar excess over probe) containing a wild-type (WT) or mutant (MT) PSE sequence of mouse U6 were added to the reactions in lanes 5 and 6. Preimmune (PI) and immune (I) sera (1 mul) against Oct-1 (lanes 7 and 8), PTFgamma (lanes 9 and 10), or PTFdelta (lanes 11 and 12) were incubated with the reaction mixture after the addition of DNA probe.

HeLa nuclear extracts (3 mul of each, 24 mug of protein) treated as indicated above the lanes were separated by electrophoresis on an SDS­10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose.

Reactions in lanes 5 to 8 were supplemented with highly purified PTF (0.25 mul in lane 5; 0.5 mul in lane 6; 1 mul in lanes 7 and 8).

Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  (46). Given that the PSE is the only common essential proximal promoter element of snRNA genes and that TBP is involved in transcription by all three polymerases, PTF may interact with TBP. In fact, Sadowski et al. (36) recently reported that SNAPc, a PSE-binding activity closely related to PTF, is a unique TBP-TAF complex different from SL1, TFIID, or TFIIIB, although TBP was found in markedly substoichiometric amounts (14). To investigate a possible interaction or association between PTF and TBP, we immunopurified PTF from HeLa cell nuclear extracts by using preimmune or immune anti-PTFdelta antibodies cross-linked to protein A-agarose beads. The bound proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the presence of TBP was analyzed by immunoblotting. When immunoprecipitation was performed in buffer containing 0.1 M KCl (Fig. 5A), PTF was efficiently and specifically purified from nuclear extracts with the immune antibodies (lanes 2 to 5), and a significant amount of TBP was coprecipitated with PTF (lane 5). However, when immunoprecipitation was carried out in buffer containing 0.4 M KCl (Fig. 5B), TBP was not detectable in the pellet fraction even though PTF was still efficiently precipitated by the immune antibodyimmobilized beads (lanes 4 and 5). The interaction between PTF and TBP was also examined in a reciprocal experiment in which the epitope (FLAG)-tagged TBP and its associated proteins were immunopurified with the anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose from nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells constitutively expressing the tagged TBP. Similar methods have been previously used to purify TFIID and TFIIIB (6). The Western blotting (immunoblotting) with anti-TBP antibodies showed that most tagged TBP was precipitated with the antibody-coated resin (Fig. 5C, lane 6). Although some PTF was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with tagged TBP (lane 6), overall recovery (less than 1%) was too little relative to that for TBP (near 100% of tagged TBP, which consists of about 50% of the total TBP) to account for an equimolar association of PTF subunits with TBP. These results indicate that the  interaction between TBP and PTF in solution is sensitive to high salt, and possibly to the TBP-antibody interaction, and thus that TBP is not tightly associated with PTF. Since the interaction between TBP and PTF was detected by immunoprecipitation, GST pulldown assays were performed to examine potential direct interactions between TBP and individual PTF subunits. As shown in Fig. 5D, both PTFgamma and  FIG. 4. PTFdelta is required for the activation of human U1 and U2 genes. In vitro transcription reactions were performed in either mock-depleted (lanes 1, 6, and 7) or PTFdelta-depleted (lanes 2 to 5 and 8 to 11) nuclear extract as described in Materials and Methods. The templates used are the wild-type U1 plasmid (pU1*G-; lanes 1 to 5), the wild-type U2 plasmid (pU2*G-; lanes 6, 8, and 10), or the mutant U2 plasmid (pU2*ABCG-; lanes 7, 9, and 11). Reactions in lanes 3, 4, 5, 10, and 11 were supplemented with highly purified PTF (0.25 mul in lane 3; 0.5 mul in lane 4; 1 mul in lanes 5, 10, and 11).

(A) Immunoprecipitation of PTF performed in buffer containing 100 mM KCl. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described in Materials and Methods with preimmune (PI) and immune (I) antibodies against PTFdelta. Aliquots of input (4 mul of nuclear extract; lane 1), supernatants (Sup; 4 mul; lanes 2 and 3), and eluates (10 mul; lanes 4 and 5) were analyzed by electrophoresis on an SDS­10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was first probed with anti-TBP antibodies (lower panel) and then reprobed with anti-PTFdelta antibodies (upper panel). (B) Immunoprecipitation of PTF performed in buffer containing 400 mM KCl. (C) Immunoprecipitation of TBP. TBP and its associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from extracts prepared from normal HeLa cells (N) or cells expressing the FLAG-tagged TBP (T) as described in Materials and Methods, using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies. Aliquots of input (4 mul of extract; lanes 1 and 2), supernatants (4 mul; lanes 3 and 4), and eluates (10 mul; lanes 5 and 6) were analyzed by immunoblotting following electrophoresis on an SDS­10% polyacrylamide gel. The blot was first probed with anti-PTFdelta antibodies (lower panel) and then reprobed with anti-TBP antibodies (upper panel). (D) Independent binding of PTFgamma and PTFdelta to the core domain of TBP. GST pulldown assays were performed in either 100 mM KCl (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) or 400 mM KCl (lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9) as described in Materials and Methods, using the GST fusion protein indicated above each lane. Aliquots of input (2 mul of labeled in vitro-translated FLAG-tagged PTFgamma or PTFdelta; lane 1) and bound proteins (from 5 mul of input per reaction) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by fluorography. Interaction assays were conducted individually with either PTFgamma (top panel) or PTFdelta (bottom panel).  Downloaded from mcb.asm.org at BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM on November 6, 2009  PTFdelta were retained by immobilized GST-TBP (lanes 4 and 5) and by GST-TBPC (lanes 8 and 9) but not by GST alone (lanes 2 and 3) or by GST-TBPN (lanes 6 and 7). The interactions were strong enough to survive washing in 400 mM KCl in this assay (lanes 5 and 9). These results show that PTFgamma and PTFdelta each have the capacity to interact directly with the core domain of TBP, although the interactions with TBP may be stronger (more salt resistant) for the free subunits than for the bound (within PTF) subunits. PTF is a stable complex of four subunits. We previously defined four polypeptides of 180, 55, 45, and 44 kDa as PTF subunits by virtue of their copurification with PTF activities through multiple chromatographic steps (46). To test whether these polypeptides form a tightly associated complex in solution, a partially purified PTF fraction (0.3M KCl fraction from the Q-Sepharose column in the second chromatographic step) was incubated with anti-PTFdelta antibody-conjugated beads. After extensively washing the beads, we analyzed the bound proteins by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. As shown in Fig. 6A (see also the figure legend), the four polypeptides were precipitated specifically by the immune antibodies but not by the preimmune antibodies. From these data, we conclude that the polypeptides form a tightly associated complex, since the complex was resistant to the high salt (0.4 M KCl) and detergent (0.1% Nonidet P-40) conditions used during the immunopurification. To more clearly identify the polypeptide bands in the immunopurified complex, we performed immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against individual PTF subunits and TBP. As shown in Fig. 6B, antibodies against PTFalpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta reacted efficiently with polypeptides of 180, 55, 45, and 44 kDa, respectively, in the HeLa nuclear extract (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). Protein bands of the same molecular sizes were detected in the immunoprecipitate obtained with anti-PTFdelta antibodies (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8), showing that the four polypeptides correspond to the PTF subunits originally determined by conventional purification. However, although TBP was present in the partially purified PTF fraction used for immunopurification (data not shown), it was not detected in the high-salt immunoprecipitate (lanes 9 and 10), even after 10-fold-longer exposure (lanes 11 and 12). This result indicates that PTF subunits do not interact as strongly with TBP as they do with one another. TBP requirements for pol II-transcribed snRNA genes. In an effort to establish an in vitro transcription system for  snRNA genes reconstituted with purified or recombinant components and to thereby dissect the mechanism of differential selection of RNA polymerases in snRNA gene transcription, we determined the TBP requirement for class II snRNA genes. HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated with polyclonal antiTBP antibodies to deplete TBP. TBP and TBP-containing complexes were then added to the depleted extracts to test for restoration of U1 transcription. As shown in Fig. 7, TBP depletion greatly reduced the transcription from the U1 promoter compared with the mock depletion (lanes 2 and 3), in agreement with previous reports (4, 36). Addition of recombi FIG.  6. PTF is composed of four polypeptide subunits. (A) SDS-PAGE analysis of immunoprecipitated protein with anti-PTFdelta antibodies. Partially purified PTF (200 mul of the Q-Sepharose fraction) was incubated in BC400­0.1% Nonidet P-40 with protein A-Sepharose beads (20 mul) coated with antibodies purified from preimmune (PI) and immune (I) sera of PTFdelta. After the resin was washed extensively, the bound proteins were eluted with 0.2 M glycine (pH 2.5) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The polypeptides were visualized by silver staining.

The positions of U1 and readthrough (RT) transcripts are indicated at the left.  nant TBP restored U1 transcription to a level comparable to that in the mock-depleted extract (lane 4). However, TFIID or TFIIIB isolated by affinity purification of epitope-tagged complexes from HeLa cells did not restore U1 transcription (lanes 5 and 6), even though they fully restored transcription of the adenovirus major late and VAI promoters in the same extract (data not shown; see reference 46). Moreover, the observation that TFIID and TFIIIB did not alter transcription in a mockdepleted extract (data not shown) argues against the possibility that they contain a U1-specific inhibitor. Purified PTF, which is free of TBP, although active in transcription assayed in PTFdepleted extracts, did not activate U1 transcription in the TBPdepleted extracts (lane 7). TBP and PTF were not limiting in the mock-depleted extracts, since further additions did not substantially increase transcription (lanes 8 and 9). These results indicate that neither TFIID nor TFIIIB can fulfill the TBP requirement of U1 transcription and thus that the TBP in these complexes is, as previously reported (6, 10, 28, 40, 48), stably bound to the corresponding TAFs. These results parallel those observed for 7SK and U6 RNA transcription in response to TBP, TFIID, and TFIIIB in TBP-depleted extracts (46). DISCUSSION The PSE is a key promoter element common to all snRNAtype genes and plays a major role in snRNA gene transcription. The PSE site is recognized by PTF, a factor which can interact with the enhancer-bound transcription factors (e.g., Oct-1) to stimulate the basal transcription, communicate with both class II and class III basal transcription factors, and thereby assist in recruiting an appropriate RNA polymerase to the target promoter. In an effort to study the function of PTF, and to understand the mechanism of snRNA gene transcription in particular, we have cloned and expressed cDNAs encoding two PTF subunits. Cloning of cDNAs encoding PTFgamma and PTFdelta. Large-scale purification of human PTF made it possible to obtain enough peptide sequence information to clone cDNAs corresponding to PTF subunits. Ponceau S staining performed following the transfer of purified protein to a membrane revealed four major polypeptides with an approximate 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry, in agreement with the estimation from the peptide profile follow ing  HPLC purification and consistent with the idea that PTF contains equimolar amounts of four subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta). All peptide sequences obtained from 45- and 44-kDa protein bands were found in the amino acid sequences deduced from PTFgamma and PTFdelta cDNAs, indicating that each band in purified PTF contains mainly one polypeptide species. For PTFgamma and PTFdelta, we obtained a group of independent cDNA clones which were apparently derived from a single mRNA species, as judged by partial sequencing. Protein database searches with the predicted amino acid sequence of PTFdelta failed to reveal extensive sequence similarity to other known sequences. However, there is weak similarity between the proline-rich region of PTFdelta and the carboxylterminal domain of RNA pol II, which is manifested by the conserved spacing of prolines but of unknown significance. Recombinant PTFdelta does not show any independent PSE-binding activity (data not shown), consistent with our earlier observation (46) that only the largest subunit of PTF is UV cross-linked to DNA. Together with the fact that the deduced sequence of PTFdelta does not contain any known DNA-binding motifs, these data suggest that PTFdelta is not involved in DNA binding. While this report was in preparation, Henry et al. (14) reported purification of SNAPc and cloning of a subunit designated SNAPc43. A sequence comparison revealed that PTFgamma is identical to SNAPc43, indicating that PTF/SNAPc is the major PSE-binding activity in the cell. The deduced amino acid sequence of PTFgamma does not have significant similarity to other sequences in the available protein databases. Although PTFgamma is a highly charged protein which contains patches of basic amino acids that could interact with DNA, in vitro-translated PTFgamma does not bind the PSE. Rather, PTFgamma may interact with other factors involved in snRNA gene transcription, an idea supported by the observation that transcription from both class II and class III snRNA genes is specifically inhibited by direct addition of purified anti-PTFgamma antibodies which presumably interfere with an interaction(s) between PTF and another transcription factor(s) in the reaction (data not shown). Indeed, the GST pulldown assays (Fig. 5D; reference 14) indicate that PTFgamma may directly interact with TBP. In addition to PTF, PBP and SNAPc have been shown to bind the PSE and to activate transcription from both classes of snRNA genes (4, 32, 36, 41, 46). The finding that the sequence of PTFgamma is identical to that of SNAPc43 demonstrates that PTF is identical or closely related to SNAPc. Highly purified SNAPc was found to contain mainly 50-, 45-, and 43-kDa polypeptides, with trace amounts of 200- and 54-kDa proteins (14). Although the precise relationship between the two factors remains to be determined, on the basis of the reported composition of PTF and SNAPc, it is likely that the 200-, 54-, and 45-kDa protein bands of SNAPc correspond to PTFalpha, -beta, and -delta subunits, respectively. We have made antibodies to cloned PTF subunits for probing PTF function. Anti-PTFgamma and PTFdelta antibodies recognize PTF in solution, as judged by EMSA (Fig. 2), showing that the cDNA clones encode bona fide PTF subunits. More importantly, transcription from both pol II- and pol III-dependent snRNA genes was inhibited by depletion with both anti-PTFgamma and anti-PTFdelta antibodies but restored by addition of highly purified PTF (Fig. 3 and 4 and data not shown). These results provide strong evidence that PTFgamma and PTFdelta are both involved in transcription of class II and class III snRNA genes. Together with the observation that individual PTF subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) are coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 6A) and apparently derived from single mRNA species, these results also argue for the involvement of a single PTF species in these processes.

Recent studies from several laboratories have indicated that all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases require TBP for transcription from both TATAcontaining and TATA-less promoters. TBP also has been shown to be required for transcription from both pol II-dependent (4, 36) and pol III-dependent (27, 38, 46) snRNA genes. Given that the PSE may be considered as a core promoter element for both classes of snRNA genes and that TBP participates in transcription in association with factors (TAFs) that confer particular functional activities to distinct TBP-TAF complexes such as SL1, TFIID, and TFIIIB (16), the potential interaction or association between PTF and TBP was investigated. Immunoprecipitation data (Fig. 5) indicate that PTF can interact with TBP in solution. However, the interaction between TBP and PTF is relatively weak, showing a marked sensitivity to high salt, and the TBP/PTF ratio is clearly substoichiometric. This finding contrasts significantly with what has been observed for the very stable SL1, TFIID, and TFIIIB TBP-TAF complexes and leaves open the question (see below) as to whether the SNAPc/PTF-TBP complexes should be considered formally equivalent to the more stable TAF-TBP complexes containing stoichiometric levels of TBP. Purified SNAPc was shown by immunoblot analysis to contain TBP which comigrated with a 45-kDa polypeptide. However, it is likely that TBP was only a minor component of purified SNAPc, since the 45-kDa band yielded only peptide sequences unrelated to TBP (14). Unlike SNAPc, highly purified PTF does not contain TBP that can be detected by immunoblot analysis. Furthermore, immunopurification of PTF (Fig. 6) has demonstrated that the four subunits of PTF are tightly associated with each other and that TBP is apparently absent from the PTF complex. In addition, anti-TBP antibodies did not affect the mobility of the PTF-PSE shift in EMSA, although antibodies against each PTF subunit did supershift the complex (45). Considering the fact that a substoichiometric level of TBP coimmunoprecipitates with PTF in low salt (Fig. 5; reference 14) and that a detectable amount of TBP copurifies with PTFgamma/SNAPc43 under certain purification conditions (14), it is possible that PTF can loosely associate with TBP to form SNAPc, which might thus be regarded as a TAF-TBP complex specific for snRNA gene transcription. Relevant to this point, it is noted that free TBP and a pol II-specific TAF complex have been separately isolated in yeast cells (35), whereas TBP of higher eukaryotes is tightly and quantitatively complexed with TAFs in the corresponding TFIID. The integrity of a putative TBP-PTF complex may be affected by the methods used to prepare cell extracts and by the protein fractionation conditions. The more important question is whether, as proposed by Sadowski and colleagues (36), the presumed SNAPc/PTF-TBP complex binds to and functions through the PSE of U6 and 7SK genes while another molecule of TBP binds to and functions at the TATA box, or whether, as we suggest, PTF and TBP (or a distinct TBP-TAF complex; see below) can interact separately with the two promoter elements. In the latter case, subsequent interactions between PTF subunits and TATA-bound TBP could contribute to the overall activation mechanism (including stabilized binding), and the physical interaction data presented here indicate that such interactions may be mediated by both PTFgamma (Fig. 5D; reference 14) and PTFdelta (Fig. 5D). However, the observed interactions of TBP with PTFgamma and PTFdelta could also be relevant to the stable binding of a PTF-TBP or SNAPc complex at the PSE (independently of the TATA element). Reconstitution of PTF and SNAPc with recombinant subunits and biochemical dissection of in vitro transcription systems for both classes of snRNA genes should resolve this question.  Factor requirements for human snRNA gene transcription. We previously have shown (46) that the TBP requirement for U6 and 7SK genes cannot be supplied by highly purified TFIIIB or TFIID preparations which are fully functional for transcription of VAI and typical pol II-dependent genes, respectively. Functional TFIIIB containing only TBP and a 90kDa subunit (TFIIIB90) has been purified recently from HeLa cells, and the cDNA encoding TFIIIB90 has been isolated (42). Interestingly, TFIIIB90 appears to be required for transcription of U6 and 7SK genes as well as the VAI gene, since immunodepletion of TFIIIB90 impaired transcription from both promoters. However, the core TFIIIB (TBP-TFIIIB90 complex) failed to restore U6 and 7SK transcription, although it was sufficient to restore VAI transcription (42). These results suggest that transcription of U6 and 7SK genes may require an additional component(s) associated with TFIIIB90 in a modified TFIIIB complex. This presumed component is not TFIIIC1 (47) or 0.48M-TFIIIB (28), since both are required for transcription of the VA1, U6, and 7SK genes. Relevant to the foregoing discussion, the weak substoichiometric association of such a complex with PTF might account for the presence of trace amounts of TBP in low-salt immunoprecipitates of PTF (Fig. 5) and in SNAPc (14, 36). As an extension of our previous studies on factor requirements for class III snRNA genes, we have tested the TBP requirement for U1 transcription (Fig. 7). Our finding that neither TFIID nor TFIIIB can fulfill the TBP requirement for U1 transcription is in agreement with reports from other laboratories (4, 36) and parallels the results of similar studies on U6 and 7SK transcription. Unlike SNAPc, which is reported to restore U1 transcription when added to TBP-depleted extracts, PTF fails to restore U1 transcription in such an assay. Instead, TBP alone can fully support U6 and 7SK transcription. However, whether free TBP rather than a TBP-TAF complex does function on the U1 promoter in intact cells is a matter of conjecture. It is possible that TBP is stoichiometrically but weakly associated with specific TAFs in vivo and that it is easily dissociated by anti-TBP antibodies in vitro. Our data are compatible with the idea that either PTF or other (e.g., TFIIIBinteracting) components may function as loosely associated TAFs. TFIIB and BRF, the yeast homolog of TFIIIB90, have been shown to interact with pol II and III, respectively (3, 5, 12, 21, 29, 43). In light of evidence that TFIIIB90 is involved in transcription of class III snRNA genes (42) and that TFIIB is involved in transcription of class II snRNA genes (4, 45), it is likely that the recruitment of either TFIIIB90 or TFIIB to snRNA promoters is one of the key steps in determining polymerase specificity. The availability of recombinant PTF subunits will allow us to examine the interplay between the key factors and to gain a better understanding of the mechanism involved in polymerase selection in snRNA gene transcription.

																																				<Abstract>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.</Abstract>

In fact, death domains now appear to define interaction domains that are capable of both homotypic and heterotypic associations (Song et al., 1994; Boldin et al., 1995a, 1995b; Hsu et al., 1995; Chinnaiyan et al., 1995; Stanger et al., 1995). These observations suggest that death domains may function as adaptors to couple some members of the TNFR superfamily (at least TNFR1 and Fas) to other signaling proteins. TRADD contains an N-terminal region of unknown function and a C-terminal death domain that is 23% identical to the death domain of TNFR1. TRADD may play an obligatory role in TNFR1 responses, since its overexpression activates TNFR1-like signaling pathways for both apoptosis and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB (Hsu et al., 1995). Similarly, overexpression of FADD (Boldin et al., 1995a; Chinnaiyan et al., 1995) or RIP (Stanger et al., 1995) mimics Fas activation, leading to programmed cell death. However, the mechanisms of signaling by TRADD, FADD, and RIP are not identical. Whereas the induction of cell death by TRADD or RIP requires only their death domains, apoptosis induced by FADD overexpression occurs independently of its C-terminal death domain. This suggests that FADD contains a "death effector" domain at its N-terminus, which may bind downstream apoptosis-signaling molecules for recruitment to Fas via death domain interactions. The second family of signal transducing proteins utilized by the TNFR superfamily are the TNFR-associated factors (TRAFs). TRAF1 and TRAF2 were biochemically purified as TNFR2-associated proteins of 45 and 56 kDa, respectively (Rothe et al., 1994). TRAF1 and TRAF2 exist in a multimeric complex that interacts via TRAF2 with the signaling domains of both TNFR2 and CD40 (Rothe et al., 1994, 1995). TRAF3 was identified by two-hybrid interaction cloning as a CD40-associated protein of 64 kDa (Hu et al., 1994; Cheng et al., 1995; Mosialos et al., 1995; Sato et al., 1995). The three known TRAFs share a highly conserved C-terminal "TRAF domain" of about 150 amino acids, which is involved in oligomerization and receptor association (Rothe et al., 1994, 1995; Cheng et al., 1995; Sato et al., 1995). Overexpression of TRAF2, but not TRAF1 or TRAF3, activates NF-kappaB (Rothe et al., 1995). Furthermore, a truncated TRAF2 lacking its N-terminal RING finger acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation mediated by both TNFR2 and CD40 (Rothe et al., 1995). Therefore, TRAF2 is a common mediator of signal transduction by TNFR2 and CD40 and, perhaps, by other members of the TNFR superfamily. Two of the most important activities of TNF, apoptosis and NF-kappaB activation, are signaled by TNFR1 following its oligomerization by the trimeric TNF (Tartaglia and Goeddel, 1992). We recently reported the molecular cloning and characterization of TRADD, a novel protein that specifically interacts with the death domain of TNFR1 and activates signaling pathways for both of these activities when overexpressed (Hsu et al., 1995).  Summary Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappaB through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappaB and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappaB activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominantnegative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappaB activation. Thus, these two TNFR1­ TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD. Introduction Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a proinflammatory cytokine whose pleiotropic biological properties are signaled through two distinct cell surface receptors (reviewed by Tartaglia and Goeddel, 1992; Rothe et al., 1992). TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1; 55­60 kDa) and TNFR2 (75­80 kDa) are expressed on most cell types and are 30% identical in their extracellular, cysteine-rich, ligand-binding regions (Loetscher et al., 1990; Schall et al., 1990; Smith et al., 1990). This extracellular domain architecture is characteristic of the larger TNFR superfamily, whose members include the Fas antigen, CD27, CD30, CD40, and several other receptors (reviewed by Smith et al., 1994). With the exception of TNFR1 and Fas, both of which can induce programmed cell death through a shared 80 amino acid "death domain" of 28% identity (Tartaglia et al., 1993a; Itoh and Nagata, 1993), the cytoplasmic domains of receptors in this superfamily share no obvious sequence similarities. Until recently, the molecular mechanisms utilized by members of the TNFR family to generate cellular responses have remained largely undefined. However, during the past year an improved understanding of these mechanisms has begun to emerge with the identification of two distinct classes of receptor-associated proteins, both of which appear to couple these receptors to downstream signaling cascades. Three intracellular proteins that contain death domains were identified through yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning by virtue of their interactions with the death domains of TNFR1 and Fas. TRADD is a 34 kDa protein that interacts specifically with TNFR1 (Hsu et al., 1995),  Cell 300  Figure 1. TNF Induces Association of TRADD with TNFR1 We treated U937 cells (5 X 107 ) with TNF for 15 min (lanes 2 and 4) or left them untreated (lanes 1 and 3). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TNFR1 monoclonal antibody 985 (lanes 3 and 4) or with mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) control antibody (lanes 1 and 2). Coprecipitating TRADD was detected by immunoblot analysis using rabbit anti-TRADD antiserum. Positions of molecular mass standards (in kilodaltons) are shown. Figure 2. Predicted Amino Acid Sequence of Murine FADD The amino acid sequences of murine and human FADD are aligned. Identical residues are stippled The death domain of FADD extends from amino acids 104­177, as indicated by the brackets.  Here we show that under normal conditions the association of TRADD with TNFR1 is TNF dependent. We also show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 through its N-terminal half and with FADD through its C-terminal death domain. Furthermore, dominant-negative mutants of TRAF2 and FADD can block TNF-mediated NFkappaB activation and cell death, respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that TNFR1 utilizes distinct TRADD-dependent mechanisms to activate signaling pathways for NF-kappaB activation and apoptosis. Results Interaction of TRADD with TNFR1 Is TNF Dependent We previously demonstrated that TRADD specifically associates with TNFR1 when both proteins are overexpressed (Hsu et al., 1995). To determine whether the TRADD­TNFR1 interaction is physiologically relevant, we performed the following experiment using human U937 cells. Lysates from cells that had been treated with TNF for 15 min or left untreated were immunoprecipitated with a nonagonistic monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of TNFR1. Coprecipitating TRADD was detected by immuoblot analysis using a TRADD-specific polyclonal antiserum. TRADD coprecipitated with TNFR1 only in the TNFtreated cell lysates (Figure 1). Since TNF induces trimerization of TNFR1, this result suggests that the recruitment of TRADD to TNFR1 probably depends on a properly aggregated TNFR1 cytoplasmic domain. Identification of TRAF2 and FADD as TRADD-Interacting Proteins To identify potential downstream components of the TNFR1/TRADD signaling pathway, we used the yeast two-hybrid system (Fields and Song, 1989) to screen cDNA libraries for TRADD-interacting proteins. Multiple cDNA clones were obtained that encode several distinct proteins. As expected, two classes of clones encoded TRADD itself or portions of the intracellular region of TNFR1. Surprisingly, many of the cDNA clones were found to encode portions of TRAF2, a protein that interacts with TNFR2 and CD40 and transduces the signal  for NF-kappaB activation by these two receptors (Rothe et al., 1994, 1995). The interaction of TRADD with TRAF2 was verified in yeast two-hybrid interaction assays using full-length TRAF2. TRADD was also found to interact strongly with TRAF1, and more weakly with TRAF3, in two-hybrid assays (data not shown). The two-hybrid screen also yielded cDNA clones encoding full-length murine FADD and the C-terminal 126 amino acids of murine FADD. The 205 amino acid murine FADD shares 73% identity with human FADD throughout the region (amino acids 1­177) comprising the effector and death domains, whereas the C-terminal 30 amino acids are very poorly conserved (Figure 2). Since FADD was originally identified owing to its interaction with Fas (Boldin et al., 1995a; Chinnaiyan et al., 1995), we compared the relative strength of the TRADD­FADD and Fas­FADD interactions in two-hybrid assays. These experiments indicated that FADD consistently interacts 10- to 20-fold more strongly with TRADD than with Fas (data not shown). Since TRAF1, TRAF2, and FADD interact strongly with TRADD in two-hybrid tests, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays to test whether these proteins might interact in human cells. An expression vector encoding TRADD was transfected alone or with expression vectors encoding Flag epitope­tagged TRAF1, TRAF2, or FADD into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody against the Flag epitope, and coprecipitating TRADD was detected by Western blotting with antiTRADD polyclonal antibody. TRAF1, TRAF2, and FADD were individually able to coprecipitate TRADD (Figure 3).  Mapping of TRADD­TRAF2 and TRADD­FADD Interaction Domains To determine the region(s) of TRADD responsible for interaction with TRAF2 and FADD, a series of N-terminal and C-terminal TRADD truncation mutants were examined in two-hybrid assays (Figure 4A). A C-terminal deletion mutant of TRADD lacking its entire death domain retained TRAF2-binding activity. This demonstrated that the TRAF2-binding domain resides in the N-terminal half (amino acids 1­169) of TRADD. A further C-terminal deletion mutant (TRADD[1­106]) failed to interact with TRAF2. In contrast, TRADD interacts with FADD through its C-terminal death domain (amino acids 195­312). This  TNFR1­TRADD Signaling Pathways 301  is the same region of TRADD that is required for interaction with the death domain of TNFR1 (Hsu et al., 1995). Deletion studies on TRAF2 indicate that its TRAF-C domain (amino acids 348­501) was sufficient for TRADD binding (Figure 4B). Previous studies had shown that the entire TRAF domain (amino acids 264­501) of TRAF2 can self-associate and interact with TRAF1, TNFR2, and CD40 (Rothe et al., 1994, 1995).  Figure 3. In Vivo Interaction of FADD and TRAF Proteins with TRADD We transfected 293 cells (2 X 10 6) with the indicated combinations of expression vectors for TRADD and Flag epitope­tagged TRAF1, TRAF2, or FADD. After 24 hr, extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody. Coprecipitating TRADD was detected by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibody against TRADD. Positions of molecular mass standards (in kilodaltons) are shown.  Figure 4. Mapping of TRADD­TRAF2 and TRADD­FADD Interaction Domains (A) Interaction of TRAF2 and FADD with the N- and C-terminal domains of TRADD, respectively. Expression vectors encoding wildtype TRADD or the indicated deletion mutants fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain were cotransformed into yeast Y190 cells with a GAL4 activation domain­TRAF2 or GAL4 activation domain­FADD expression vector. (B) The TRAF domain of TRAF2 interacts with TRADD. Expression vectors encoding wild-type TRAF2 or the indicated deletion mutants fused to GAL4 activation domain were cotransformed into yeast Y190 cells with a GAL4 DNA-binding domain­TRADD expression vector. The TRAF domain of TRAF2 can be subdivided into two parts, a coiled-coil (CC) region and a C-terminal (TRAF-C) region (Rothe et al., 1994). Transformation mixes were plated on synthetic dextrose plates lacking tryptophan and leucine. Filter assays were performed for beta-galactosidase activity. Plus signs represent blue color development; minus signs indicate no color development.  TRADD Recruits TRAF Proteins to TNFR1 The interaction of TRADD with TNFR1 and TRAFs occurs via its C-terminal death domain and N-terminal TRAFbinding domain, respectively. Therefore, TRADD might be able to bind simultaneously both TNFR1 and TRAFs, thereby recruiting TRAFs to the TNFR1 complex. To explore this possibility, we cotransfected 293 cells with plasmids that direct the synthesis of TNFR1, TRADD, and Flag-tagged TRAF1 or TRAF2. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with agonistic polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of TNFR1, and coprecipitating TRAF proteins were detected by Western blotting with an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody. In lysates prepared from cells programmed for ectopic expression of TNFR1 and TRAF1 or TRAF2, antibody against TNFR1 failed to coprecipitate TRAF proteins (Figure 5A). This result, which suggests that no direct interaction occurs between the TNFR1 and TRAF1 or TRAF2, is in agreement with results obtained previously by yeast two-hybrid interaction assays (Rothe et al., 1995). However, when the same experiments were performed on lysates from cells that also expressed TRADD, both TRAF1 and TRAF2 were coimmunoprecipitated with TNFR1 (Figure 5A). These results provide evidence that TRADD can serve as an adaptor protein and recruit TRAF1, TRAF2, or both to TNFR1. Since TRAF2 is capable of interacting with both TNFR2 and TRADD, we also considered the possibility that TRAF2 could recruit TRADD to the TNFR2 receptor complex. This was examined by cotransfection and immunoprecipitation experiments similar to those described above for TNFR1. However, no ternary TNFR2­ TRADD­TRAF2 complex could be detected (data not shown), demonstrating that TRAF2 cannot simultaneously bind to both TNFR2 and TRADD. This finding suggests that TNFR2 and TRADD, both of which interact with the C-terminal TRAF domain of TRAF2 (see Figure 4B; Rothe et al., 1994), compete for the same, or an overlapping, binding site on TRAF2.  TRADD Enhances Association of FADD with TNFR1 The strong interaction between TRADD and FADD occurs via their death domains. TRADD also associates with TNFR1 through death domain interactions. To determine whether TRADD can simultaneously interact with both FADD and TNFR1 to recruit FADD to TNFR1, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. FADD coprecipitated with Fas, consistent with previous results (Chinnaiyan et al., 1995), whereas no detectable FADD coprecipitated with TNFR1 (Figure 5B). In contrast, when TNFR1 and FADD were expressed in the  Cell 302  Figure 5. TRADD Recruits TRAF1, TRAF2, and FADD to TNFR1 (A) Coimmunoprecipitation of TNFR1­TRADD­TRAF complexes. We transfected 293 cells (2 X 10 6 per 100 mm plate) with the indicated combinations of expression vectors for TNFR1, TRADD, Flag­ TRAF1, or Flag­TRAF2. After 24 hr, extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum (odd-numbered lanes) or with polyclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of TNFR1 (even-numbered lanes). Coprecipitating Flag­TRAF1 and Flag­TRAF2 were detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody. (B) Coimmunoprecipitation of TNFR1­TRADD­FADD complexes. We transfected 293 cells with the indicated combinations of expression vectors for Fas, TNFR1, TRADD, Flag­FADD, TRAF1, and TRAF2. Western blotting analysis indicated that Flag­FADD expression levels were similar in all samples (data not shown). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with preimmune (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7), anti-Fas (lane 2), or anti-TNFR1 (lanes 4, 6, and 8) antiserum. Coprecipitating Flag­FADD was detected with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody.  presence of TRADD, FADD could be detected in the antiTNFR1 immune complex. However, even under these conditions, the amount of FADD that coprecipitated with TNFR1 was less than with Fas. The addition of TRAF1 and TRAF2 did not inhibit, but rather slightly enhanced, the ability of TRADD to recruit FADD to TNFR1 (Figure 5B). This result shows that TRADD can simultaneously recruit TRAF proteins and FADD to TNFR1. Furthermore, these experiments suggest that, whereas TRADD­FADD and TRADD­TNFR1 complexes are relatively stable, trimeric TNFR1­TRADD­FADD complexes may exist only transiently or may require other proteins for their stabilization. NF-kappaB Activation by TNFR1 Requires TRAF2 The activation of NF-kappaB by TNFR2 and CD40 is mediated by TRAF2 (Rothe et al., 1995). The presence of TRAF2  in the TNFR1 complex suggests that it may also be involved in signaling TNFR1 responses. However, our previous experiments using a dominant-negative mutation of TRAF2 lacking the N-terminal 86 amino acids that comprise the RING finger domain (TRAF2[87­501]) failed to demonstrate a role for TRAF2 in TNFR1-initiated NF-kappaB activation (Rothe et al., 1995). To examine further a potential role for TRAF2 in NF-kappaB activation by TNFR1, we selected the 293 cell line, since electrophoretic mobility shift assays have shown that TNF activates NF-kappaB exclusively through endogenous TNFR1 in these cells (Rothe et al., 1995). We reasoned that our earlier failure to see an effect of TRAF2(87­501) on signaling through endogenous TNFR1 might be related to the stability of the TNFR1­ TRADD­TRAF complex. In those experiments, TNF stimulation had been performed shortly after transfection, perhaps before the newly synthesized TRAF2(87­501) could displace endogenous TRAF1/TRAF2 from the complex. Therefore, we performed a time course experiment in which TNF was added at various times following TRAF2(87­501) transfection (Figure 6). We found that 293 cells transfected with a control expression vector responded to TNF with an approximately 20-fold increase in NF-kappaB reporter gene activity. When TNF stimulation was performed 16 hr after transfection with the TRAF2(87­501) expression vector, NF-kappaB activation was only partially compromised (approximately 7-fold activation). However, the inhibitory effect of TRAF2(87­501) increased with time. TRAF2(87­501) expression completely blocked TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation (1.2 +/- 0.2-fold activation) when TNF treatment was performed 48 hr after transfection (Figure 6). Similar results were obtained using HeLa cells (data not shown). TNF and interleukin-1 (IL-1) elicit many similar biological activities, including NF-kappaB activation in 293 cells. To determine the specificity of the observed TNF-inhibitory effect of TRAF2(87­501), we compared the effect of TRAF2(87­501) overexpression on NF-kappaB activation by these two cytokines. In a dose-response experiment, low levels (0.1 mug) of TRAF2(87­501) expression vector were sufficient to inhibit TNF-induced NF-kappaB-dependent reporter activity significantly, and high levels (3.2 mug) completely blocked activation. In contrast, overexpression of TRAF2(87­501) had no effect on IL-1-mediated NF-kappaB activation (Figure 7). These results provide strong evidence that the TRAF2(87­501) dominant-negative mutant is inhibiting NF-kappaB activation in a specific manner and that TRAF2 plays an important role in TNFR1 signaling.  The Apoptotic Pathway Activated by TNFR1 Does Not Require TRAF2 Two important activities of TNF signaled through TNFR1 are activation of NF-kappaB and induction of apoptosis. Overexpression of the TNFR1-associated protein TRADD can trigger both activities by activating two distinct signaling pathways (Hsu et al., 1995). However, overexpression of TRAF2 activates NF-kappaB (Rothe et al., 1995), but does not induce cell death (H. H. and D. V. G., unpublished data), suggesting that TRAF2 may not be an essential component of the TNFR1­TRADD apoptotic signaling cascade. To examine further whether TRAF2  TNFR1­TRADD Signaling Pathways 303  completely blocked cell death (Table 1). Taken together, these observations strongly support a model for signaling by the TNFR1 complex in which TRAF2 is dispensable for apoptosis, but essential for NF-kappaB activation. The Death Domain of FADD Inhibits TNF-Induced Apoptosis Overexpression of FADD has been shown to induce programmed cell death (Boldin et al., 1995a; Chinnaiyan et al., 1995). This activity requires only amino acids 1­117 of FADD (Chinnaiyan et al., 1995). Futhermore, a FADD deletion mutant lacking amino acids 1­79 acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of Fas-mediated apoptosis, demonstrating that the Fas apoptotic pathway requires FADD (V. M. Dixit, personal communication). Since FADD can directly associate with TRADD, we considered the possibility that FADD may also participate in TNF-induced cell death. We examined the effect of a deletion mutant of FADD lacking its 79 N-terminal amino acids (FADD[80­205]) on TNF-mediated killing of HeLa cells. Overexpression of wild-type FADD, but not FADD(80­205), was able to trigger cell death in these cells, in accordance with previous findings (Chinnaiyan et al., 1995). Importantly, FADD(80­205) was a potent inhibitor of TNF-mediated apoptosis, blocking cell death as effectively as CrmA (Table 1). Similar results were obtained using mouse NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown). It has been shown previously that overexpression of either TRADD (Hsu et al., 1995) or TNFR1 (Boldin et al., 1995b) triggers cell death, presumably through an aggregation phenomenon that activates a TNFR1 signaling cascade. However, when 293 cells (Figure 7) or HeLa cells (data not shown) were cotransfected with the FADD(80­205) expression vector, neither TRADD nor TNFR1 overexpression induced cell death. The strong dominant-negative effect of FADD(80­205) on cell death induced by TNF, TNFR1, and TRADD suggests that FADD participates in the apoptotic pathway activated by TNF through TNFR1 and TRADD. The Death Domain of FADD Does Not Inhibit TNF-Mediated NF-kappaB Activation Since FADD(80­205) potently inhibits the TNFR1­ TRADD pathway that triggers apoptosis, we asked whether it might also block the TNFR1­TRADD NF-kappaB activation pathway. In a dose-response experiment, FADD(80­205) overexpression failed to inhibit TNFinduced activation of an NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene (Figure 8). In fact, when expressed at high levels, FADD(80­205) itself activates NF-kappaB. However, NF-kappaB activation mediated by TNF was still observed above these FADD(80­205)-induced levels. FADD(80­205) also failed to inhibit NF-kappaB activation triggered by overexpression of TRADD or TNFR1 (data not shown). These results suggest that FADD does not play a role in the TNFR1­TRADD signaling cascade leading to NF-kappaB activation. Discussion Recently, several novel proteins have been identified that interact with members of the TNFR superfamily to initiate intracellular signal transduction events (Rothe et  Figure 6. The TRAF2(87­501) Dominant-Negative Mutant Specifically Inhibits TNF-Induced NF-kappaB Activation (A) Time-dependent effect of TRAF2(87­501) expression on TNFinduced NF-kappaB activation.

In this assay (Hsu et al., 1995), cells are cotransfected with a beta-galactosidase expression plasmid. The cells are treated 36 hr later with TNF for 12 hr and then scored for cell death. Overexpression of TRAF2(87­501) had no protective effect in these assays, whereas CrmA, a known inhibitor of TNF-mediated apoptosis (Tewari and Dixit, 1995; Enari et al., 1995)  Cell 304  Figure 7. FADD(80­205) Inhibits Apoptosis Induced by Overexpression of TRADD and TNFR1 We transiently transfected 293 cells (2 X 105 ) with the indicated expression vectors (1 mug) and analyzed them 24 hr later by phase-contrast microscopy. Scale bar is 50 mum.  al., 1994; Hu et al., 1994; Boldin et al., 1995a; Cheng et al., 1995; Chinnaiyan et al., 1995; Hsu et al., 1995; Mosialos et al., 1995; Sato et al., 1995; Stanger et al., 1995). These signaling proteins fall into two structural classes, containing either death domains (TRADD, FADD, and RIP) or TRAF domains (TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3). The death domain­containing proteins are involved in signaling by TNFR1 and Fas antigen, two receptors which themselves contain death domains. Therefore, death domains, in addition to their clear involvement in apoptotic signaling, appear to define sequences involved in protein­protein interactions. In contrast, the TRAF domain proteins interact with receptors (TNFR2 and CD40) that have no recognizable domains or motifs. The results of these initial cloning experiments seemed to confirm earlier predictions (Dembic et al., 1990; Lewis et al., 1991; Goodwin et al., 1991) that TNFR1 and TNFR2 would be found to activate independent and distinct signal transduction pathways. TRADD interacts with the death domain of TNFR1 to initiate distinct signaling cascades for two of the most important biological activities of TNF, NF-kappaB activation and programmed cell death (Hsu et al., 1995). Our finding that this interaction is TNF dependent suggests that the death domains of TRADD and TNFR1 do not interact with each other as monomers. Instead, the trimeric TNF is likely to induce trimeric or perhaps higher order aggregates of TNFR1 (Banner et al., 1993) that are stabilized by the self-associating death domain of TNFR1 (Song et al., 1994; Boldin et al., 1995b). These aggregated  TNFR1 death domains would then provide a high affinity binding site for TRADD, perhaps itself in a preassociated state (Figure 9). A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify TRADD-interacting proteins as candidate signal transducers for the NF-kappaB and apoptotic pathways. We isolated several clones encoding TRAF2, a 56 kDa protein originally purified through its association with TNFR2 (Rothe et al., 1994) and later shown to be a common mediator of NF-kappaB activation by TNFR2 and CD40 (Rothe et al., 1995). Thus, the two known classes of signal transducers for the TNFR family, TRAF domain and death domain proteins, are capable of direct interaction. We also isolated cDNAs encoding FADD, a death domain­containing protein previously shown to interact with Fas and to trigger cell death when overexpressed (Boldin et al., 1995a; Chinnaiyan et al., 1995). TRADD­TRAF2 Interaction and Activation of NF-kappaB The identification of a TRADD­TRAF2 complex raised the possibility that TRAFs might associate indirectly with TNFR1 and TRADD might associate indirectly with  Table 1.

TRADD (perhaps as an oligomer) associates via its own death domain with the aggregated death domain of TNFR1 to initiate signaling cascades for both apoptosis and NF-kappaB activation. TRAF2 and FADD are TRADD-interacting proteins that define the NF-kappaB and cell death pathways, respectively (see text).  TNFR2. We found that TNFR1­TRAF­TRAF complexes can indeed exist. Conversely, TNFR2­TRADD­TRAF complexes cannot form, presumably because TNFR2 and TRADD compete for binding to similar sites in TRAF domains. These findings were conceptually appealing for two reasons. First, both TNFRs are independently capable of NF-kappaB activation (Wiegmann et al., 1992; L--greid et al., 1994; Rothe et al., 1994; Hsu et al., 1995) and association with TRAF2, a protein whose overexpression leads to NF-kappaB activation (Rothe et al., 1995). Second, of the two TNFRs, only TNFR1 interacts with the cell death­inducing protein TRADD (Hsu et al., 1995), and this receptor also exerts a far more dominant role in the signaling of apoptosis than does TNFR2 (Tartaglia et al., 1991, 1993b). The role of TRAF2 in TNFR1 signaling was examined by expressing TRAF2(87­501), a truncated version of TRAF2 lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain. This dominant-negative TRAF2 mutant can inhibit NF-kappaB activation by TNFR2 and CD40 (Rothe et al., 1995). When overexpressed in 293 cells, TRAF2(87­501) blocked NFkappaB activation by TNF, a process that is TNFR1 dependent. NF-kappaB activation by the cytokine IL-1 was unaffected by TRAF2(87­501), demonstrating that TRAF2 is not involved in IL-1 signaling. TRAF2(87­501) overexpression also had no effect on TNF-mediated apoptosis. This result is consistent with TRAF2 defining a point at  which the two (or more) TNFR1­TRADD signal transduction pathways diverge. The TRAF2 pathway, which is shared with TNFR2, CD40, and probably other members of the TNFR superfamily, ultimately would result in NFkappaB activation. On the surface, the results described here would seem to contradict our earlier characterization of TRADD deletion mutants (Hsu et al., 1995). In those experiments we showed that a TRADD mutant (TRADD[195­312]) lacking amino acids 1­194 was capable of activating NF-kappaB when overexpressed. This result implied that the N-terminal 194 amino acids of TRADD, and by inference proteins such as TRAF2 that bind to this region of TRADD, would not be required for NF-kappaB activation. This apparent paradox can be explained by the following experimental result. We have found that the NF-kappaB activation pathway induced by TRADD(195­312) can be potently inhibited by overexpression of the TRAF2(87­501) dominant-negative mutant (data not shown) and is therefore TRAF2 dependent. To date, all TRAF2-dependent pathways for NF-kappaB activation appear to require TRAF2 aggregation (Rothe et al., 1995). Therefore, our current interpretation of these data is that TRADD(195­315) overexpression leads to aggregation of endogenous TRADD and its associated TRAF2. Many details of the molecular mechanism(s) by which TRAF2 activates NF-kappaB remain a mystery. NF-kappaB consists of p50 and p65 subunits that are normally associated with the cytoplasmic inhibitor protein IkappaB (Liou and Baltimore, 1993; Beg and Baldwin, 1993). Activation of NF-kappaB by the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF (Osborn et al., 1989) results in rapid serine phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB, releasing NF-kappaB for translocation to the nucleus (Beg et al., 1993; Palombella et al., 1994). The phosphorylation of IkappaB is thought to be the cytokine-regulated step that targets IkappaB for degradation by the constitutive ubiquitin­proteasome pathway (Thanos and Maniatis, 1995). In this regard, TNF has been shown to activate a TNFR1-associated serine protein kinase activity (VanArsdale and Ware, 1994). If one assumes this kinase is required for NF-kappaB activation by TNF, then the essential role of the RING finger domain of TRAF2 in NF-kappaB activation might be to regulate kinase activity, recruit the kinase to the TNFR1 signaling complex, or both.  TRADD­FADD Interaction and Signaling of Apoptosis The strong interaction observed between the death domains of TRADD and FADD suggested the possibility that TRADD might be able to recruit FADD to TNFR1. Indeed, low levels of FADD were found in the TNFR1 complex when FADD, TRADD, and TNFR1 were coexpressed, raising the question of whether FADD is involved in TNFR1-mediated signaling. To address a possible role for FADD in signal transduction by TNFR1, we examined an N-terminal deletion mutant of murine FADD obtained in our two-hybrid screen. Expression of FADD(80­205) completely blocked cell death induced by TNF treatment, or by overexpression of TNFR1 or TRADD, without affecting NF-kappaB activation. The anti-apoptotic activity of FADD(80­205) in  Cell 306  these assays was as potent as that of CrmA and much more potent than Bcl-2 (Hsu et al., 1995). A similarly truncated human FADD acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of Fas-mediated apoptosis (V. M. Dixit, personal communication). Therefore, FADD may be a component of the cell death pathways triggered by both TNFR1 and Fas. Alternatively, FADD(80­205) may exert its dominant-negative effect through titration of an unidentified component of the TNFR1 cell death pathway. However, high level expression of FADD(80­205) did not appear to interfere with TRADD binding to TNFR1 (data not shown). The signaling of cell death by TNFR1 and Fas is not well understood, but considerable evidence suggests the apoptotic pathway requires activation of a protease cascade that ultimately leads to cleavage of cell death substrates (reviewed by Martin and Green, 1995). CrmA expression blocks this pathway by directly binding to cysteine proteases of the CED-3/interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) family (Tewari and Dixit, 1995; Enari et al., 1995; Los et al., 1995). Presumably, FADD(80­205) blocks the cell death pathway at a receptor-proximal step that precedes protease activation, either by displacing FADD or by tying up other components required to execute the death signal(s). As such, FADD(80­205) should be a useful reagent for dissecting apoptotic cascades initiated by other events. Apoptosis mediated by TNFR1 and Fas are similar in that both signaling cascades are initiated by death domains and end in activation of ICE-like protease(s). However, clear differences in these two cell death pathways have been observed (Wong and Goeddel, 1994; Schulze-Osthoff et al., 1994). For example, Fas-mediated cell death occurs much more rapidly than that triggered by TNFR1 (Clement and Stamenkovic, 1994; Abreu-Martin et al., 1995). These differences might be due to differential contributions from other, non-FADD components of the receptor complexes. It is also possible that the greater affinity of FADD for Fas than for TNFR1­ TRADD observed in our coimmunoprecipitation experiments might reflect affinity differences under physiological conditions. In turn, the amount of FADD present in the respective receptor complexes might correlate with potency of the death signal.  Experimental Procedures Reagents and Cell Lines Recombinant human TNF and IL-1 were provided by Genentech. The rabbit anti-TNFR1, anti-Fas, and anti-TRADD antisera and the monoclonal antibody against the Myc epitope tag have been described previously (Tartaglia et al., 1991; Wong and Goeddel, 1994; Hsu et al., 1995). Monoclonal antibody 985 against the extracellular domain of TNFR1 was provided by Genentech. The monoclonal antibody against the Flag epitope was purchased from Kodak International Biotechnologies. The human 293 embryonic kidney (R. Tjian), human HeLa derivative HtTA-1 (H. Bujard), human U937 histiocytic lymphoma (G. Wong), and murine NIH 3T3 fibroblast (American Type Culture Collection) cell lines were obtained from the indicated sources. Expression Vectors Mammalian cell expression vectors encoding TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF2(87­501), and CrmA have been described previously (Hsu et al., 1995; Rothe et al., 1995). The expression vectors for Fas were provided by Dr. V. Dixit. The full-length FADD and FADD(80­205) expression plasmids was prepared by inserting a SalI­NotI fragment from the two-hybrid FADD cDNA clones inframe with an N-terminal Flag epitope in the vector pRK5. The control expression plasmid pRK5, the NF-kappaB reporter plasmid pELAMluc, and pCMV-betagal were also described previously (Hsu et al., 1995). Restriction sites in the TRADD cDNA (StuI, SmaI, and NotI) were used to obtain deletion mutants of TRADD (amino acids 1­274, 1­169, and 1­106, respectively). Wild-type and deletion mutants of TRADD were cloned into the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBT9 (Clontech). Plasmids containing the GAL4 activation domain fused with TRAF2, TRAF2(87­501), and TRAF2(264­501) were as described previously (Rothe et al., 1994, 1995). TRAF2(348­501)/ GAL4ad was generated by cloning the appropriate coding sequence into pPC86. TRAF2(1­358)/GAL4ad was provided by Dr. H. Y. Song. Yeast Two-Hybrid Cloning The plasmid GAL4bd­TRADD (Hsu et al., 1995), which encodes the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to full-length TRADD, was used as bait in two-hybrid screens of HeLa (Clontech) and mouse fetal liver stromal cell (provided by L. Lasky) cDNA libraries. The isolation of positive clones and subsequent two-hybrid interaction analyses were carried out as described elsewhere (Hsu et al., 1995). DNA sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated DNA sequencer. Transfections and Reporter Assays The 293, NIH 3T3, and HtTA-1(HeLa) cell lines were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mug/ml penicillin G, and 100 mug/ml streptomycin (GIBCO). For reporter and apoptosis assays, 2 X 105 cells per well were seeded on 6-well (35 mm) dishes. For coimmunoprecipitations, 2 X 10 6 cells per well were seeded on 100 mm plates. Cells were transfected the following day by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Ausubel et al., 1994). Luciferase reporter assays were performed as described elsewhere (Hsu et al., 1995). Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis We grew U937 cells (5 X 10 7) in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 100 mug/ml each of penicillin G and streptomycin, washed them in warm PBS, and incubated them for 15 min in the presence or absence of TNF (100 ng/ml). Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 30 mM NaF, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mug/ml aprotinin, 10 mug/ml leupeptin). Lysates were incubated with 25 mug of monoclonal antibody 985 or mouse IgG for 2 hr at 4C, then mixed with 25 mul of a 1:1 slurry of protein GammaBind G­Sepharose, and incubated for another 2 hr. The Sepharose beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer, twice with 1 ml of high salt (1 M NaCl) lysis buffer, and twice more with lysis buffer. Transfected 293 cells from each 100 mm dish were lysed in 1 ml of E1A buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.6], 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA). For each immunoprecipitation, 0.5 ml aliquots of lysates were incubated with  Conclusions The demonstration that TRADD interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, and can recruit both to TNFR1, suggested that TRAF2 and FADD may be involved in TNFR1­ TRADD-mediated signaling. That these interactions define two distinct signaling pathways emanating from TRADD (Figure 9) is supported by the ability of TRAF2 and FADD to activate NF-kappaB and induce apoptosis, respectively. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the effectiveness of dominant-negative mutants at selectively inhibiting one pathway or the other: TRAF2(87­ 501) blocks NF-kappaB activation by TNFR1 and FADD(80­ 205) blocks apoptosis. It will now be of great interest to identify downstream events in these signaling cascades that connect TRAF2 to IkappaB phosphorylation and FADD to cysteine protease activation.

The lysates were mixed with 20 mul of a 1:1 slurry of protein A­ or protein G­Sepharose (Pharmacia) and incubated for another hour. The Sepharose beads were washed twice with 1 ml of E1A buffer, twice with 1 ml of high salt (1 M NaCl) E1A buffer, and twice again with E1A buffer. The precipitates were fractionated on 10% SDS­PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Subsequent Western blotting analyses were performed as described elsewhere (Hsu et al., 1995). Apoptosis Assays Transfected HeLa cells were washed with PBS, fixed in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min at 4C, and washed again with PBS. Fixed cells were stained overnight with PBS containing 1 mg/ml X-Gal, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mM MgCl2 , 0.02% NP-40, 0.01% SDS. The number of blue-staining cells was determined microscopically. We analyzed 293 cells for apoptosis by phase-contrast microscopy 24 hr after transfection.

																																					<Abstract>In eukaryotic cells, the coordinated activation of different cyclin-dependent kinases regulates entry into S-phase. In vitro and in nonproliferating cells, p27 associates with and inhibits cyclin/cycin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes containing either CDK4, CDK6, or CDK2. Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different CDKs: CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. Furthermore, the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rb-kinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6-specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone H1. These data are consistent with a model wherein cyclin D/CDK complexes sequester the CDK2-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p27.</Abstract>

Although many different types of proliferating cells contain p27 protein, neither the interactions of p27 with cyclin/CDK complexes nor the consequences of this interaction during the mitotic cycle have been fully explored. We report that, in MANCA cells, the amount of p27 is constant during the cell cycle. In addition, p27 associates with three different  and CDK2 kinases are rate limiting for entry into (2-4).

Furthermore,  G1 checkpoints  are known  as CKls (7). There  the amount of p27 is significantly lower than the amount of cyclin D3 in these cells. The amount of CDK4 and CDK6 associated with p27 does not change in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; in contrast, the amount of CDK2 associated with p27 is lowest in early G1 cells and increases to a maximum in mid-G1 phase, reaching a steady-state level in late G1-phase cells. After mid-G1 phase, the amount of each p27/CDK complex remains constant through the remainder of the cell cycle. p27-immunoprecipitates contain an Rbkinase activity. The substrate specificity, the expression pattern of this kinase, and the ability to deplete 50% of this kinase activity with a CDK6specific antibody suggest that the CDK6 protein mediates, in part, the p27-associated Rb-kinase activity. In contrast, p27 complexes containing CDK2 are incapable of phosphorylating histone HI.

We lysed exponentially growing either rabbit antimouse immunoglobulin antibody (RaM) or affinity-purified p27 antibody (op27) as indicated above each lane. We probed each pair of immunoprecipitates with the carboxyl-specific CDK antibody indicated below the panel. B, p27 does not interact with CDKs that do not have a Gi function. The same conditions as in A apply, but we included an immunoprecipitate of PITALRE in the presence and absence of extract as indicated. We used a previously described serum for the CDC2 immunoprecipitation (44). C, p27 interacts exclusively with a slower mobility form of CDK4. We immunoprecipitated with either the carboxyl-terminal-specific CDK4 antibody or affinity-purified p27 antibody (indicated above each lane) and then detected these proteins by immunoblotting with either the CDK4 or p27 antibodies (in the left and right panels, respectively). We included 30 Lg of MANCA cell extract in each immunoblot. It is important to note that this amount of extract does not reflect the amount of protein used in each immunoprecipitation. D, association of cyclins with p27. We prepared lysates from either G1 (Lanes 1 and 3) or S-phase (Lanes 2 and 4) cells and immunoprecipitated proteins with affinity-purified p27 antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose (Lanes 1 and 2).

We obtained rabbit antimouse a rabbit with mouse  antibody from Zymed Laboratories. We generated the p27 antibody by immunizing  GST-p27 fusion protein. We made GST-p27 by ligating the mouse p27 cDNA into pGEX-2T (Pharrnacia). We prepared antigen using the denaturation-renaturation protocol we described previously. Briefly, after isopropyi-1 -thio-f3-c-galadopyranoside induction, we collected insoluble proteins and denatured these in 8 M urea-5 m DTT. After dialysis into 0.2 M Tns (pH 8.0), 0.5 M NaCI, and 1 m.i DTT, we purified proteins on glutathione-agarose columns. We purified p27 antibody as we described previously (48). Briefly, we passed the serum from the immune rabbit through a GST column before adsorbing antibodies specific for p27 on a GST-p27 column. We used CNBr-activated Sepharose as the column support. We eluted the p27specific antibodies with sodium iodide/sodium thiosulfate and dialyzed into PBS. Subsequently, we determined the specificity of these antibodies. We constructed and purified GST-p21 fusion protein in an identical manner to that described above for GST-p27. We could not detect GST-p2i either by immunoprecipitation or immunoblothng with the affinity-purified, p27specific antibodies. In addition, we could not detect any of the Gi cyclins (cyclins Dl , D2, D3, E, and A) or CDKs (CDK2 and CDK4) expressed in baculovirus systems with this antibody. Northern Blot Analysis. We prepared total RNA using RNA-STAT 60 described by the manufacturer. We electrophoresed 10 g of RNA on an 1 .2% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred the RNA to Genescreen plus(Dupont).

																																					<Abstract>The syntrophins are a biochemically heterogeneous group of 58-kDa intracellular membrane-associated dystrophin-binding proteins. We have cloned and characterized human acidic (alpha 1-) syntrophin and a second isoform of human basic (beta 2-) syntrophin. Comparison of the deduced amino acid structure of the three human isoforms of syntrophin (together with the previously reported human beta 1-syntrophin) demonstrates their overall similarity. The deduced amino acid sequences of human alpha 1- and beta 2-syntrophin are nearly identical to their homologues in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the individual isoforms, Much like beta 1-syntrophin, human beta 2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In contrast, human alpha 1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues. Somatic cell hybrids and fluorescent in situ hybridization were both used to determine their chromosomal locations: beta 2-syntrophin to chromosome 16q22-23 and alpha 1-syntrophin to chromosome 20q11.2. Finally, we used in vitro translated proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay to show that, like beta 1-syntrophin, both beta 2- and alpha 1-syntrophin interact with peptides encoding the syntrophin-binding region of dystrophin, utrophin/dystrophin related protein, and the Torpedo 87K protein.</Abstract>

The Journal of Cell Biology, Vol 104, 1633-1646, Copyright © 1987 by The Rockefeller University Press ARTICLES A postsynaptic Mr 58,000 (58K) protein concentrated at acetylcholine receptor-rich sites in Torpedo electroplaques and skeletal muscle SC Froehner, AA Murnane, M Tobler, HB Peng and R Sealock In the study of proteins that may participate in the events responsible for_SP_ _SP_organization of macromolecules in the postsynaptic membrane, we have used a_SP_ _SP_mAb to an Mr 58,000 protein (58K protein) found in purified acetylcholine_SP_ _SP_receptor (AChR)-enriched membranes from Torpedo electrocytes. Immunogold_SP_ _SP_labeling with the mAb shows that the 58K protein is located on the_SP_ _SP_cytoplasmic side of Torpedo postsynaptic membranes and is most concentrated_SP_ _SP_near the crests of the postjunctional folds, i.e., at sites of high AChR_SP_ _SP_concentration. The mAb also recognizes a skeletal muscle protein with_SP_ _SP_biochemical characteristics very similar to the electrocyte 58K protein. In_SP_ _SP_immunofluorescence experiments on adult mammalian skeletal muscle, the 58K_SP_ _SP_protein mAb labels endplates very intensely, but staining of extrasynaptic_SP_ _SP_membrane is also seen. Endplate staining is not due entirely to membrane_SP_ _SP_infoldings since a similar pattern is seen in neonatal rat diaphragm in_SP_ _SP_which postjunctional folds are shallow and rudimentary, and in chicken_SP_ _SP_muscle, which lacks folds entirely. Furthermore, clusters of AChR that_SP_ _SP_occur spontaneously on cultured Xenopus myotomal cells and mouse muscle_SP_ _SP_cells of the C2 line are also stained more intensely than the surrounding_SP_ _SP_membrane with the 58K mAb. Denervation of adult rat diaphragm muscle for_SP_ _SP_relatively long times causes a dramatic decrease in the endplate staining_SP_ _SP_intensity. Thus, the concentration of this evolutionarily conserved protein_SP_ _SP_at postsynaptic sites may be regulated by innervation or by muscle_SP_ _SP_activity.

<BodyText>Characterization of Adenosine Deaminase Binding to Human CD26 on T Cells and Its Biologic Role in immune Response' Rui-Ping Dong,* Junichi Kameoka,* Martin Hegen,* Toshiaki Tanaka,* Yuhui Xu,+ Stuart F. Schlossman,* and Chikao Morimoto2* CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV, is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA to CD26 and the functional consequences of thisinteraction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lineslacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that theassociation between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and11-2 production induced by various stimuli.On the other hand, cells expressingADA and CD26 on the surfacewere much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing thelocal concentration of adenosine. The Journal of Immunology, 1996, 156: 1349-1 355.  D26, a T cell activation Ag (1-3), is a I IO-kDa cell surface glycoprotein with known dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV'; EC 3.4.14.5) activity in its extracellular domain which is present on various cell types, including T cells and epithelial cells of the liver, kidney, and intestine (4-8). This ectoenzyme is capable of cleaving amino-terminal dipeptides from polypeptides with either L-proline or a alanine at the penultimate position; however, a significant physiologic substrate remains to be identified (8). Considerable evidence suggests that CD26 can deliver a potent costimulatory signal to T cells (2, 9-13). Crosslinking CD26 and CD3 with solid phase immobilized mAbs (mAbs) can induce T cell costimulation and IL-2 production in either human CD4' T cells or Jurkat T cell lines transfected with CD26 cDNA ( 1 0, 12). Moreover, we showed that DPPIV enzymatic activity was required for the costimulatory activity of CD26 using wild-type (CD26'/DPPIV+) and mutant (CD26'/DPPIV-) transfected Jurkat cells (12). The cDNA sequence of CD26 predicts a type I1 membrane protein with only six amino acids in its cytoplasmic region, suggesting that in addition to DPPIV enzymatic activity, other signal-inducing molecules may be associated with CD26 (14). There is evidence to suggest that CD26 interacts, presumably in its extracellular domain, with CD45, a protein-tyDivisionsof*TumorImmunologyand+StructuralMolecularBiology,DanaFarher Cancer Institute and Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical Boston, M A 021 15  C  School,  Recelved for publication October 2, 1995.

I Abbreviations used in this paper: DPPIV, dipeptldyl peptidase IV; ADA, adenosine deaminase; ADABP, adenosine deaminase binding protein; dCF, deoxycoformycin.  '  '  rosine phosphatase, and ADA (adenosine aminohydrolase), both of which may be of importance in T cell activation and signal transduction (15, 16). ADA (EC 3.5.4.4), an enzyme involved in the salvage of purine nucleosides, catalyzes the irreversible hydrolytic deamination of adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine to inosine and 2'-deoxyinosine, respectively. Although this enzyme is present in all mammalian tissues, it appears to play a major role in the development and function of lymphoid tissue. It has been shown that deficiencies in ADA activities are related to the abnormalities in immunologic development as well as some hematologic malignancies (17-21). We and other groups demonstrated that CD26 was directly associated with ADA and was identical with the ADA binding protein (ADABP) reported previously (16, 22, 23). ADAis co-expressed with CD26 on Tcells and Jurkat CD26 transfectants through the extracellular domain of CD26 (16). The mechanisms by which CD26 and ADA are naturally associated on the cell surface are still unclear because the predicted amino acid sequence from the ADA cDNA contains no hydrophobic signal sequence (24). Four possible mechanisms may be proposed: I ) ADA may be transported to the surface after binding to CD26 inside the cells; 2) ADA expressed on the cell surface may be through a yet to be defined mechanism not requiring hydrophobic domains, as is predicted from the secretion of IL- 1 and fibroblast growth factor (25, 26); 3) ADA on the cell surface may be derived from external sources; or 4) there may be another mRNA encoding a secreted form of ADA. Furthermore, the biologic significance of the ADA bound to CD26 on T cell surface is unclear; for example, it is not known whether the ADA bound to CD26 is functional or only a degraded product. Here we show that the binding between CD26 and ADA is not affected by DPPIV and ADA enzymatic activity and occurs in the extracellular space, based on the following data: 1) CD26 and ADA co-localize on the cell surface, but not inside cells; 2) neither CD26 on the surface of T cells nor CD26-transfected Jurkat cells are saturated with ADA; and 3) under specific cell culture conditions, cell surface ADA can be shown to derived from the intracellular ADA of other be 0022-1 767/96/$02.00  Copyright 0 1996 by The American Association of Immunologists  1350 cells. In addition, we show that ADA on the cell surface is functional and can help the cell to overcome the toxic effects of high levels of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA may be involved ina novel regulatory mechanism by which ADA released from the cytoplasm binds to cell surface CD26 and as a complex may be able to reduce the local concentrationof adenosine, which is known to be inhibitory for T cell activation.  ASSOCIATION O ADA WITH CD26 ON T CELLS F viously described (32). Sections were double labeled by incubations with o a mixture of mouse anti-CD26 (lF7) and rabbit anti-ADA primary Abs f r 30 min. The washed sections were then exposed to a mixture of secondary Abs: a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with 5-nm gold particles, used to reveal CD26, and a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with IO-nm gold particles to reveal ADA. After counterstaining with 4% uranyl acetate and embedding in 1.25% methylcellulose. the sections were examined with a JEOL l00CX electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA) at 60 kV using a 20-mm objective aperture.  Materials and Methods Cells and reagents Human PBMC were isolated from healthy volunteer donors by FicollHypaque (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) density gradient centrifugation (3). Unfractionated mononuclear cells were separated into an E rosette-positive population and were used as resting T cells. DPPIV enzymatic activity-positive and -negative CD26-transfected and vector onlytransfected Jurkat cell lines had previously been described (12). The method used for human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines, 300.19, has been described previously ( 1 2, 27). TJF-2, a T cell line established from an ADA-deficient patient, was kindly provided by Dr. R. M. Blaese (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) (28). Monoclonal Abs reactive with the lymphocyte surface Ags CD3 and CD26 was previously described (3). Rabbit polyclonal anti-human ADA Ab, kindly provided by Dr. J. W. Belmont (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston. TX), was raised against a 15-amino acid peptide identical with the COOH-terminus of human ADA (29). Rabbit anti-bovine ADA serum, which also cross-reacts with human ADA, was kindly provided by Dr. R. M. Blaese. Deoxycoformycin was a gift from Parke-Davis (Ann Arbor, MI). Adenosine and bovine ADA were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).  T cell proliferation assays One hundred microliters of PBS containing 0.5 pg/ml of anti-CD3 (OKT3) mAb was coated in 96-well flat-bottom plates (Coulter, Cambridge, MA) in triplicate and incubated overnight at 4°C as described previously (10). Be1 fore use, these plates were washed once with 200 p of PBS. After removal of monocytes by adherence to a plastic plate for 4 h and incubation with 5 mM L-leucine methyl ezter HCI (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 1 h, E+ T cells were resuspended at 1 X 10' in 200 pl of serum-free medium (AIM-V, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) containing different concentrations of nucleosides with or without ADA. Cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO, humidified atmosphere for 3 days. Cells were pulsed with 1 pCi/well of ['Hlthymidine (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA) 18 h before harvesting onto glass fiber filters (Wallac, Turku, Finland), and the incorporated radioactivity was quantified by a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac). Results were expressed as the mean counts per minute for triplicate cultures. For the effect of adenosine on the proliferation of Jurkat transfectants, Jurkat transfectanta were resuspended at 2 X IO4 in 200 p of AIM-V containing 1 different concentrations of adenosine and I pCi1well of [3HJthymidine. Cells were harvested at 24 h.  IL-2 production assay Ab-coated plates and purified T cells were prepared as described above. 1L-2 production by Jurkat transfectant cells was assayed in duplicate wells in 96-well flat-bottom plates coated with I pglml of anti-CD3 mAb in 200 pl of RPMI medium containing nucleosides/ADA, as described above for the proliferation assays. After 24 h of incubation, culture supernatants were pooled from the duplicated wells and assayed for IL-2 content by ELISA (Biosource International, Camarilla, CA).  Immunofluorescence analysis All procedures were conducted at 4"C, and flow cytometry analysis was performed using an EPICS V cell sorter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) (3, 16). AntiLCD3 and anti-CD26 mAbs were used as ascites at a dilution of 111000. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human ADA and anti-bovine ADA were used at dilutions of 11500 and 1/200, respectively. For coculture studies, the human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell line 300.19 ( I X IOh/ml),the CD26-negative Jurkat parental cell line (I X 106/ml), and the mixture of both cells (5 X 10s/mI each) were incubated overnight at 37°C and then stained with anti-human ADA, anti-CDR (OKT3), and anti-CD26 ( I F 7 ) Abs as previously described (3).  Results Association of ADA with CD26 was maintained in cell lines that lacked ADA or DPPIV enzymatic activity O u r previous report clearly showed that DPPIV enzymatic activity played an important role in T cell costimulation (12, 13). To determine whether the enzymatic activity of DPPIV was required for the association of ADA with CD26, we performed immunoprecipitation of I2'I- labeled wild-type (CD26+/DPPIV+), mutant (CD26+tlDPPIV-), and vector only-transfected Jurkat cell lines by anti-CD26 mAb, 1F7. As shown in Figure IA, co-precipitation of both CD26 ( I 10 kDa) and ADA proteins (43 kDa) was observed in wild and mutant types, but not in vector only-transfected Jurkat cell lines, indicating that the association of ADA with CD26 did not require DPPIV enzymatic activity. Prior amino acid sequence analysis and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that this 43-kDa protein was ADA (16). Next, we examined whether the enzymatic activity of ADA was required for the association of ADA with CD26. For this purpose, we used a T cell line, TJF-2, established from an ADA-deficient patient. This cell line had been shown to have a normal size ADA mRNA and to produce a defective ADA protein that was immunoreactive with anti-ADA antisera but lacked catalytic activity (28). Immunoprecipitation showed that ADA was co-precipitated with CD26 from this cell line (Fig. le),and i n other studies treatment with a ADA inhibitor, deoxycoformycin (dCF), did not inhibit ADA binding to CD26 (datanot shown), indicating that ADA enzymatic activity was not necessary for the binding of ADA to CD26. Immunofluorescence analysis by flow cytometry also showed that this cell line expressed both CD26 and ADA, and the levels of expression were comparable to those in PHA blasts derived from normal controls (data not shown).  Immunoprecipitation analysis Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed as previously described ( 1 6, 30). Briefly, Jurkat transfectants or the TJF-2 cell line were labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination. The lysates were incubated with PBS containing anti-CD26 (1 F7) ascites or anti-CDI (T6) ascites at a dilution of 1/1000 for 4 h before precipitation with goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to Afi-Gel (Bio-Rad, Melville, NY). Immune complexes were then washed l extensively and eluted by boiling for 5 min in 50 p of SDS (Sigma Chemical Co.) sample buffer before analysis by SDS-PAGE.  Pre-embedding immunogold labeling of cell surface Ags Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 0.5% OVA, IO pg/ml of mouse anti-CD26 (IF7), and rabbit anti-ADA primary Abs at 4°C for up to 2 h. The cells were washed thoroughly in PBS at 4°C and incubated with second Abs: a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with 5-nm gold particles used to reveal CD26, and a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated withIO-nm gold particles to reveal ADA for an additional 60 min. Cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound gold conjugate, fixed in 1.5% buffered glutaraldehyde, processed into plastic embedding, sectioned, and stained, and micrographs were obtained as previously described (31).  Ultrathin frozen section immunolabeling electron microscopy Immunolabeling electron microscopy was performed as described previously (32). Cells were harvested and fixed in Zamboni fixative containing 0. I % glutaraldehyde for I h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, cells were infused with 2.3 M sucrose overnight at 4°C and then frozen and stored on stainless steel stubs in liquid nitrogen until used for ultrathin frozen sectioning. After cutting 60- to 80-nm frozen sections with a Reichert Ultracut Ultramicrotome fitted with an FC4D cryochamber at a temperature range of - 1 10 to - 130"C, the sections were mounted on Formvar/carbon-coated 200-mesh 1-in, grids and immunolabeled as pre The  Journal of Immunology  1351  A kDa 205 106  1  -  2  3  B kDa  205 106 80  1  2  0  80   50   50   "ADA  33   33   FIGURE  1. Co-immunoprecipitation of ADA with CD26.

B, A T cellline, TJF-2, established from an ADA-deficient patient, was surface labeled with '*'I andimmunoprecipitated by isotype-matchedcontrol mAb (CD1; lane I ) and anti-CD26 mAb (1 F7; lane 2).  ADA was co-localized with CD26 only on the surface of CD26 Jurkat transfectants, but not inside the cells  To determine how ADA co-localizes with CD26 on the cell surface or whether the association occurs inside the cells, electron microscopic double immunostaining was performed. For this purpose, we first incubated CD26- or vector only-transfected Jurkat cells with both anti-CD26 mAb and rabbit anti-ADA Ab and added gold-labeled secondary Abs against mouse and rabbit IgGs, followed by fixation. As shown in Figure 2 A , co-localization of two different sized gold particles on the surface of CD26-transfected Jurkat cellswas observed. Large particles (ADA) were always associated with small particles (CD26). but there were many small particles that were not associated with large particles. This might indicate either that CD26 wasnot saturated by ADA on the surface of Jurkat CD26 transfectants or that the smaller gold particles bound more avidly than the larger ones due to differences in mobility and steric hindrance between small and large particles. Moreover, the fact that in an in vitro binding assay, the addition of [ '2sI]ADA resulted in further binding to CD26 on PHA blasts in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown), and the high CD26 and low ADA expression found on PHA blasts by flow cytometry assay ( I 6) support the possibility that CD26 on the cell surface was not saturated by ADA. No gold particles were detected on the surface of vector only-transfected Jurkat cells (data not shown). These results confirmed the co-expression of CD26 and ADA on the surface of CD26-transfected Jurkat cells. Next, to examine whether the association of ADA and CD26 occurred inside the cells, immunogold double labeling after fixation was performed. As shown in Figure 2B, CD26 (small gold particles) was localized primarily in association with the membrane of structures that were morphologically suggestive of lysosomes. In contrast, ADA (large gold particles) was present diffusely in the cytosol and was not associated with any organelle. We were unable to find co-localization of CD26 with ADA within the cell under the conditions we employed. From the above results, it seems unlikely that CD26 is acting as a transporter of ADA inside the cells.  FIGURE 2. lmmunogold co-localization of CD26 and ADA on CD26-transfected Jurkat cells, on the cell surface ( A ) and in the cytoplasm (6). After incubation with anti-CD26 mAb (anti-lF7) and A, rabbit anti-ADA Ab for 1 h at room temperature, cells were then processed forimmunogold detection usinggoat anti-mouse Ab conjugated to 5-nmgold particles and goat anti-rabbit Ab conjugated to 10-nm gold particles fixed in glutaraldehyde, followed by plastic embedment and thin section electron microscopy (X87,OOO).B, Electron micrograph of fixed ultrathin frozen sections o cultured CD26-transf fected Jurkat cells indirectlyimmunolabeled forhuman ADA and CD26 using 10- and 5-nm colloidal gold-conjugated secondary Abs, respectively ( X 1 8,000).

ADA on the cell surface could be derived from the intracellular ADA of cells The fact that ADA was not co-localized with CD26 inside the cells implied that the binding might occur in the extracellular space. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the distinct characteristics of binding to human CD26 between human and murine ADA. Curiously, there is evidencethat murine ADA does not bind to the human ADABP, CD26 (33, 34). We found that the human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell line 300. I9 did not co-express ADA on the cell surface, as shown by anti-ADA Ab (human ADA specific), although human CD26 was clearly expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the overnight coculture of B300.19 human CD26 transfectants with CD26-negative parental Jurkat cells resulted in a high expression of human ADA on the cell surface of 300.19 human CD26 transfectants by two-color immunofluorescence analysis. Because the only source of human ADA in this coculture system was the intracellular ADA derived from parental Jurkat cells, the human ADA detected on the cell surface of 300.19 human CD26 transfectants could only come from the ADA inside the parental Jurkat cells. This result showed that ADA inside the cells could be released into the medium, either actively or passively, and could bind to CD26 on the cell surface of other cells under in vitro cell culture conditions. Effects of adenosine on T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli  To determine whether surface ADA plays an important role in regulating extracellular concentrations of adenosine, we first determined the effects of adenosine on T cell proliferation and IL-2  1352 conk01  ASSOCIATION OF A D A WITH CD26 ON T CELLS anti-ADA  [ antkrabbil)  [ human specfc )  [ anb-mouse )  Control  antiCD3  anti-CDZ6  A I  transfected 300.19  hCD26 Parent  Jurkat  Coculture  I 1  FIGURE 3.

Purified T cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 in the presence of various concentrations of adenosine in serum-free medium. As shown in Figure 4A, adenosine inhibited T cell proliferation after stimulation with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb in a dose-dependent manner, and at 1 mM induced 100% inhibition. The inhibitory effect was blocked by the addition of exogenous ADA ( I 0 nglml) and augmented by the addition of dCF ( I O pM/ml), a competitiveinhibitor of ADA. Even after removing the free ADA in this assay system by washing, the bound ADA on the cell surface still blocked the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These results indicated that extracellular ADA could regulate the concentration of adenosine in vitro. Ten nanograms per milliliter of exogenous ADA and 10 pM/ml of dCFdid not have any effect on T cell proliferation in the absence of adenosine (Fig. 4A), suggesting that ADA and dCF were not directly involved in T cell activation. This inhibitory effect of adenosine on T cell proliferation was also observed after stimulation with a combination of immobilized anti-CD26 and a submitogenic dose of anti-CD3, soluble anti-CD2 (TI I, and T1 IJ, a mitogen, PHA, and a recall Ag, tetanus toxoid (data not shown). The concentrations of adenosine with maximum inhibition were similar regardless of the stimulus. In some, but not all, instances, adenosine enhanced T cell proliferation up to twofold at lower concentrations (&amp;lt;0.1 mM; data not shown). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of adenosine can also be observed in CD26-negative Jurkat parental T cell lines, these cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 and PMA for 24 h in the presence of adenosine, and the amount of IL-2 produced in the medium was measured by ELISA. As shown in Figure 4B, adenosine also inhibited IL-2 production by Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner, and at 2.5 mM it induced more than 50% inhibition. This suggested that adenosine might be involved in the regulation of IL-2 production.

A, Proliferation assays were performed as described in Materials and Methods, with purified E + T cells being incubated in the presence of solidphaseimmobilized antiLCD3 (1  &amp; n l ) different concentrations of adenosine with ADA or dCF or and without both. The data shown are representative of three separate experiments. 6, IL-2 production bylurkat cells induced by PMA (5 n d m l ) and solid phase immobilized anti-CD3 (1 pg/ml). After 24 h , culture supernatants were harvested and assayed for IL-2 content by ELISA. The data shown are representative of three separate experiments.  To determine whether ADA coexpressed with CD26 on the cell surface can block the inhibitory effect of adenosine, we used CD26- and vector only-transfected Jurkat cells. As described previously (1 6), the CD26-transfected Jurkat cells coexpressed ADA and CD26 on the cell surface, whereas ADA and CD26 were not detected on the surface of vector only-transfected Jurkat cells (Fig. 5.4). Importantly, these cell lines have almost identical expression of CD3. As shown in Figure SB, functionally, adenosine at 0.15 and 1 mM inhibited cell proliferation about 10-20 and 70-SO%, respectively, in the vector only-transfected cells, but up to 10 mM, adenosine only slightly (&amp;lt;8%) inhibited cell proliferation on the CD26-transfected Jurkat cells. On the other hand, adenosine at 0.5  and 2.5 mM inhibited IL-2 production approximately 40 and 50-80%, respectively, on vector only-transfected Jurkat cells, but only 10-15% on CD26-transfected Jurkat cells (Fig. 5C) These results suggested that vector only transfectants were more sensitive to the inhibitory effect induced by adenosine than the CD26 transfectants. Moreover, there was no relationship between the reduction in IL-2 secretion and decreased cell viability, since viability was examined in these cultures and found to be between 89 and 100% at each point measured (data not shown). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of adenosine correlated with total cellular ADA, we measured both cell surface and intracellular ADA in CD26- and vector only-transfected Jurkat cells using flow cytometry analysis and immunoblotting. As shown in Figure 5A, CD26-transfected cells expressed significant amounts of cell surface ADA, whereas vector only-transfected cells expressed none. More importantly, both vector only and CD26 transfectants expressed virtually identical amounts of intracellular ADA as well as a control molecule, CD45 (Fig. 5D). These data indicated that the inhibitory effects of adenosine best correlated with the expression of cell surface ADA.  Discussion In the present study, we demonstrated that ADA and DPPIV enzymatic activities were not necessary for the binding between ADA and CD26. Moreover, we provided evidence that ADA bound to CD26 on the cell surface was from an extracellular source. We showed that 1) co-localization of CD26 and ADA by immunoelectron microscopy was demonstrated on the cell surface, but not inside the cells; 2) CD26 on the surface of T Cells and  The Journal of Immunology  1353  A  (anti-rabbit)  Control  anti-ADA  (anti-mouse)  Control  anti-CD3  anti-CD26  .

In the addition, we showed that ADA on the cell surface was functional and could counteract the inhibitory effect o f elevated extracellular adenosine. We and other groups demonstrated that CD26 was identical with ADABP (16, 22, 23). However, the characteristics o f the binding  between CD26 and A D A remain unknown. O f immediate interest i s whether the expression and the DPPIV enzymatic activity o f CD26 are maintained on T cells from ADA-deficient patients. To answer this question, we used a T cell line,TJF-2, established from an ADA-deficient patient. Our analysis showed that I ) A D A could coprecipitate with CD26 in thiscell line; 2) the expression of CD26 and A D A on this cell line was comparable to that on PHA blasts derived fromnormal controls; and 3) DPPIV enzymatic  1354 activity was maintained in this cell line (data not shown). Thus, ADA binding capacity as well as the expression and DPPIV enzymatic activity of CD26 appeared to be unaffected by the deficiency of ADA enzymatic activity. On the other hand, co-precipitation of ADA with CD26 also was observed in CD26+/DpPIV- Jurkat transfectant cells, indicating that ADA could bind to CD26 without DPPIV enzymatic activity. We now know that ADA binds to CD26 on the cell surface, but whether this binding also occurs in the intracellular space remains unclear. For this purpose, we examined the co-localization of CD26 and ADA inside the cells as well as on the cell surface by immunoelectron microscopy. Co-localization was shown on the surface of CD26-transfected Jurkat cells, but not inside the cells under any of the conditions we employed, suggesting that CD26 was not acting as a transporter of ADA from cytoplasm to cell membrane and that the binding of CD26 to ADA only occurred in extracellular space. Furthermore, the results from the coculture experiment strongly suggested that, at least under specific cell culture conditions, ADA detected on the cell surface can be derived from the intracellular ADA of other cells. The released ADA may be derived from dead cells or may be secreted by an active or a passive process. Whatever the mechanism, cell surface ADA appears to be derived from an extracellular source. Despite an observed amino acid sequence homology of 80 to 85% between mouse and human ADA and mouse and human CD26, mouse ADA binds neither mouse nor human CD26 (33, 34). In this regard, our results showed that murine pre-B cell lines expressing human CD26 did not co-express ADA on the cell surface. In addition, immunoprecipitation of '2sI-labeled human CD26-transfected murine pre-B 300. I9 cells with the anti-CD26 mAb, 1F7, showed that CD26 protein (1 10 m a ) , but not ADA protein (43 kDa), was precipitated, confirming that mouse ADA did not bind to human CD26 (data not shown). Since the complete structures of both human and murine ADA and CD26 are now available, further structural studies of the precise binding site of ADA to CD26 will reveal why murine ADA does not bind to human CD26. ADA catalyzes the deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine, respectively. Individuals witha congenital deficiency of this enzyme or disruption of the ADA gene in mice have a profound impairment of T and B lymphocyte function (35-37). Although ADA is mainly located within the intracellular space, it is also expressed on the surface of T and B cells, and this expression is increased upon activation (16, 38). Thus, it was of major interest to determine whether the ADA bound to cell surface CD26 had functional significance. Our data shows the following: 1) ADA coprecipitated with CD26 is 43 kDa, the same size as normal ADA,suggesting that the ADA bound to CD26 is not a degraded product; 2) cells expressing ADA on the surface are resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine, indicating that the ADA bound to CD26 on the cell surface is functional and has enzymatic activity; and 3) the amounts of exogenous ADA that can completely block the inhibitory effect 1 mM of adenosine are sufficiently low that expressed on the surface of cells, if they would be capable of deaminating adenosine to inosine under physiologic conditions. Adenosine has been implicated as an essential mediator of biologic functions, both intracellularly and extracellularly (39), in a variety of cell types (40). However, the effect of adenosine in extracellular space during T cell activation is not well understood. It has long been known that high concentrations of adenosine inhibit the proliferation of T cells (41, 42), and this inhibitory effect of adenosine is markedly potentiated by inhibitors of ADA (43,441. In vitro studies have demonstrated that in the presence of deoxycoformycin, deoxyadenosine can inhibit T cell function similar to  ASSOCIATION OF ADA WITH CD26 ON T CELLS that observed in ADA deficiency (45, 46). Our data indicate that adenosine inhibits not only T cell proliferation induced by various stimuli, but also IL-2 production by Jurkat cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb plus PMA, and this inhibitory effect of adenosine is blocked by low concentrations of exogenous ADA ( I O ng/ml). In Jurkat transfectants, the extent of inhibition by adenosine correlates with the level of expression of ADA on the cell surface, since most of the ADA measured is intracellular. More importantly, the intracellular ADA concentration is similar in these cell lines. These data strongly suggest that ADA expressed on the T cell surface can aid the cell in resisting an inhibitory effect of adenosine by deaminating adenosine to inactive inosine, thereby reducing the effective extracellular concentration of adenosine. Under physiologic conditions, released ADA may bind to CD26 on the T cell surface and reduce the local concentration of adenosine, thus inhibiting T cell activation. In addition to its potential immunoregulatory role, adenosine is known to induce DNA fragmentation in T cells and selectively deplete the CD4+CD8+ double positive immature thymocyte subpopulation expressing a higher level of CD3+TCR (47-49). Since CD26 is expressed on the medullary thymocytes (50),it is conceivable that the CD26-ADA complex may prevent apoptosis and be involved in thymus differentiation and maturation. The absence of CD26 or its association with mutant ADA can result in selective thymocyte deletion in normal and ADAdeficient patients. CD26/ADA/adenosine may also be involved in the process of some diseases. For example, CD26 is expressed by normal melanocytes, but not by melanoma, its malignant counterpart (22). In this instance, adenosine cannot be deaminated to inosine, and the resulting increase in adenosine could then interfere with the ability of activated lymphocytes to recognize tumor cells (51). On the other hand, hairy cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are lymphoid malignancies that can express high levels of ADA and CD26. Perhaps their dramatic response to dCF and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, known inhibitors of ADA (52-54), relates to their surface expression of the ADA-CD26 complex. Moreover, in vitro, migrating T cells expressed high CD26 (55), and in vivo, large numbers of CD26-positive T cells have been found in both inflamed tissues and peripheral blood of patients with multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, and rheumatoid arthritis (56-58). Cronstein also reported that methotrexate, a folate antagonist, diminished leukocyte accumulation by increased local adenosine release at inflamed sites, and that ADA and adenosine A2 receptor antagonists of 3,7dimethyl-propargylxanthine could reverse this inhibition partially or completely (59). These data suggest that ADA and CD26 expressed on these T cells may play an important role in catalytic removal of local adenosine, resulting in a decrease in the local concentration of adenosine, which, in turn, could exaggerate the inflammatory andautoimmune responses. Accordingly, we propose that CD26 on T cells through its association with ADA can play an important role in regulating both inflammatory and tumor immune responsesby regulating the extracellular concentration of adenosine.

																																							<Abstract>The human basal transcription factor TFIIH plays a central role in two distinct processes. TFIIH is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription initiation complex. Additionally, it is believed to be the core structure around which some if not all the components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery assemble to constitute a nucleotide excision repairosome. At least two of the subunits of TFIIH (XPB and XPD proteins) are implicated in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). We have exploited the availability of the cloned XPB, XPD, p62, p44, and p34 genes (all of which encode polypeptide subunits of TFIIH) to examine interactions between in vitro-translated polypeptides by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally we have examined interactions between TFIIH components, the human NER protein XPG, and the CSB protein which is implicated in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Our analyses demonstrate that the XPB, XPD, p44, and p62 proteins interact with each other. XPG protein interacts with multiple subunits of TFIIH and with CSB protein.</Abstract>

<BodyText>second-round amplification with nested primers corresponding to amino acids 694 to 700 (forward) and 760 to 766 (reverse) of the hMRP1 sequence (5). 11. Partial cDNA clones were isolated from a rat hepatocyte cDNA library (23) that was screened with the 213-bp probe according to standard procedures (24). From a 4.5-kb positive clone, a 5'-located, 0.6kb Hph restriction fragment was used to screen a XGT1 0 5' stretch rat liver cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A 0.8-kb overlapping clone was obtained from which a 0.6-kb Ava II probe was isolated to rescreen the same library, resulting in the isolation of another overlapping clone. The 5' end of the cDNA was obtained by use of the anchored PCR procedure [M. A. Frohman, M. K. Dush, G. R. Martin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 8998 (1988)]. cDNA synthesis was carried out with 5 p.g of total RNA isolated from Wistar rat liver and random hexamer primers with Superscript Reverse Transcriptase II (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). After purification, the cDNAs were tailed with a synthetic oligonucleotide anchor sequence with the use of a 5'-RACE kit (Life Technologies). Two rounds of nested PCR (96°C, 30 s; 60°C, 30 s; 72°C, 45 s) with an anchor-specific primer and two cMOAT-specific primers [5'-TGTCCAGTATCTTCTGTGAGCG-3' (first round) and 5'-AACACGACGAACACCTGCTTGGC-3'(nested)] resulted in the isolation of the missing 5' sequence. Probes were labeled with [ca-32P]deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) with the use of random primers. Hybridization of the filters was done at 65°C in 0.5 M NaPO4 (pH 7. 0), 2 mM EDTA, and 7% SDS (hybridization solution) for 20 hours. Filters were washed four times in 2x saline sodium citrate (SSC), 1 % SDS for 30 min at 65°C and autoradiographed. Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain method [F. Sanger, S. Nicklen, A. R. Coulson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 463 (1977)]. The cmoat cDNA sequence has been deposited with GenBank (accession number L49379). 12. W. R. Pearson and D. J.

Chem. 269, 22853 (1994). 15. J. R. Riordan et al., Science 245, 1066 (1989). 16. A fusion gene, consisting of the gene for the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein and the 3' part of the cmoat cDNA corresponding to amino acids 1340 to 1541, was constructed in pMal-c [C. V. Maina et at., Gene 74, 365 (1977)]. The fusion protein was produced in E coli strain JM101 and purified by amylose resin affinity chromatography. Mice were injected three times during 6 weeks with 200 ,ug of the purified protein. The first injection was in the presence of Freund's complete adjuvant, and the subsequent boosts in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Two weeks after the final boost with a glutathioneS-transferase-cMOAT fusion protein, splenocytes were isolated and fused with myeloma cells. Hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the glutathione-S-transferasecMOAT fusion protein and subsequently tested for positivity in protein immunoblots. 17. cmoat cDNA was amplified from liver, kidney, ileum, and duodenum from both Wistar and TR- rats with primers corresponding to amino acids 366 to 375 (forward) and 451 to 458 (reverse) of the cMOAT sequence. The resulting PCR product was digested with Nla lii. PCR products from TR- rat digestion produced two bands of 206 and 66 bp, whereas in the Wistar rats three bands of 83, 122, and 67 bp were observed. 18. R. Mayer et al., J.

Henzel, Xiong Gao  The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (I L-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1 RI). When the ligand binds, IL-1 RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) overexpressing IL-1 RI or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, IRAK rapidly associated with the IL-1 RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of Pelle, a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-KB homolog in Drosophila.  Interleukin-1 is a proinflammatory cytokine that functions in the generation of systemic and local responses to infection, injury, and immunological challenges. Produced mainly by activated macrophages and monocytes, IL-1 participates in lymphocyte activation, fever, leukocyte trafficking, the acute phase response, and cartilage remodeling (1). The biological effects of IL-1 are mediated by IL-IRI located on the plasma membrane of responsive cells (2). Binding of IL-1 to its receptor triggers activation of NF-KB (3). NF-KB constitutes a family of related transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes bearing cognate DNA binding sites (4). In most cells, NFKB is retained in the cytoplasm by inhibitory proteins designated IKB's (5). In reZ. Cao and X.

Genetic studies examining the formation of dorsoventral polarity of the Drosophila embryo have shed light on the intracellular signaling pathway leading to NF-KB activation. The protein Dorsal, a homolog of NF-KB, is activated during embryogenesis to regulate gene expression essential for establishing dorsoventral polarity (7). Like NF-KB, Dorsal activity is suppressed by an IKB-like molecule designated Cactus (8). Activation of Dorsal is initiated by the interaction of an extracellular ligand designated Spaetzle with a membrane-bound receptor designated Toll (9). A potential connection between the IL-1 and Spaetzle signaling pathways was found on the basis of the sequence similarity shared by the intracellular domains of IL-IRI and Toll (10).

Total RNA was extracted according to the acid-phenol single-step method [P. Chomczynski and N. Sacchi, Anal. Biochem. 8, 148 (1987)]. Polyadenylated [poly(A)-] RNA was isolated with the polyAtract mRNA system ill (Promega). RNA was fractionated on a 0.8% denaturating agarose gel, transferred to Hybond N+ nitrocellulose membrane filters, and hybridized with a [a-32P]dCTP-labeled 21 3-bp rat lung mrpl probe and a 1-kb Hind III-Ava II fragment of cmoat in hybridization solution (11) for 20 hours at 65°C. Filters were washed 4x for 30 min in 0.2x SSC-0.1 % SDS at 65°C and autoradiographed. A 32P-iabeled 1.2-kb Pst fragment of the rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA [Ph. Forth et at., Nucleic Acid Res. 13, 1431 (1985)] was used to estimate variations in RNA loading. 29. Canalicular and basolateral membranes were iso lated  as described [P. J. Meier, E. S. Sztul, A. Reuben, J. L. Boyer, J. Ce/f Biol. 98, 991 (1984)]. Membranes, containing 50 p.g of protein, were fractionated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred by electrophoresis to nitrocellulose filters, blocked for at least 2 hours in PBS/M/T [phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 % bovine serum albumin, 1 % milk powder, and 0.05% Tween-20), and incubated with the mAb (M2 111-5 hybridoma culture medium diluted eightfold with PBS/M/T) for 2 hours. Immunoreactivity was visualized with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antibody to mouse immunoglobulin G (anti-mouse IgG) and subsequent staining with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine and 4-chloro-1 -naphthol substrate.

Although the function of Tube is unclear, Pelle is a serine-threonine kinase. Because IL- 1RI and Toll signaling pathways are related at both proximal (receptor intracellular domains) and distal (activation of NF-KB) points, it is reasonable to assume that Tubeand Pelle-like molecules may also take part in NF-KB activation in mammalian cells. We identified an IL-1-dependent kinase activity that coimmunoprecipitates with the human IL-IRI ( 12). In vitro the activity of this kinase results in phosphorylation of a 100-kD protein (pplOO) present in the receptor complex. Reasoning that pplOO might participate in IL-1-mediated signaling, we purified this protein and cloned its complementary DNA (cDNA). The human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line 293 was used to purify pplOO. The 293 cells contain small amounts of IL-IRI and can respond weakly to IL-1 as judged by NF-KB activation. The IL-1 response was enhanced when the cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding ILIRI. Concomitantly, detection of pplOO in IL-1RI immunocomplexes was enhanced in cells overproducing IL- I RI (12). We generated stably transfected 293 cell lines overproducing IL-1RI (293 IL-IRI) (13). After a brief exposure to IL-1, extracts of the 293 IL-1RI cells were prepared (14). The pplOO protein and IL-IRI were coprecipitated with polyclonal antibody directed to the extracellular domain of IL-1RI (12). The immunoprecipitated proteins were phos phorylated  in vitro in the presence of [,y-32P]adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to facilitate tracing of pplOO during subsequent purification procedures. The pplOO protein was eluted from the immunoprecipitants with 7 M urea and further purified by Q Sepharose column chromatography. Fractions containing purified pplOO were subjected to two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis (15) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Fig. 1). The pplOO protein (-0.5 ,ug) obtained from 120 liters of 293 IL-1RI cell culture (16) was subjected to micropeptide sequencing (17), and the amino acid sequences of 10 polypeptides were obtained. Amplification of cDNA prepared from 293 cells A  by polymerase chain reaction produced a DNA fragment of 356 base pairs (bp), which was used to screen a human teratocarcinoma cDNA library. The longest clone obtained (-3.5 kb) was sequenced and yielded a translated open reading frame of 712 amino acids (Fig. 2A) that predicted a molecular size of -76 kD. An inframe stop codon 36 nucleotides upstream from the first methionine indicates that the cDNA clone might encode the full-length pplOO protein. Sequence analysis revealed a hypothetical protein kinase domain (residues 208 to 524) within pplOO. Twelve subdomains including 15 highly conserved amino acids indicative of a protein kinase (18) were all  pplOO band identified by in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 1) (12). The diffuse polypeptide band recognized by the IRAK-specific antibody may represent heterogeneously phosphorylated forms of IRAK. IRAK could also be detected by protein immunoblot analysis of the IL-IRI immunocomplexes prepared from IL-1-induced, untransfected HeLa cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that the association of IRAK with IL-IRI occurs in other cell types in which IL- 1RI is not overexpressed. We tested whether IRAK was phosphorylated after its recruitment to the receptor complex. The IL-IRI complex was immunoprecipitated from 293 IL-1RI cells that had been induced with IL-I for various lengths of time, then the precipitate was analyzed by immunobloting to detect IRAK (Fig. 4C). The association of IRAK with IL-1RI was rapid-it was detectable 30 s after IL-1 treatment. Immediately after IL-I induction, only the faster migrating forms of IRAK were found in association with IL-IRI. At later time points, the majority of IRAK appeared as a band of -100 kD. Extensive phosphorylation of IRAK apparently occurs after its association with IL-IRI. Thus, IRAK may exist in an inactive state until its catalytic activity is acquired in the receptor complex .\Z Fig. 3. Detection of IRAK mRNA in in cells exposed to IL-1.

A search of the database at the National Center of Biotechnology Information with the kinase domain indicated that IRAK is related to several putative protein kinases encoded by plant cDNAs, with an overall sequence identity of 30 to 33% (19). One of the putative kinases is the product of the pto gene of the tomato plant, which confers resistance tc) the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (20). Among kinases of animal origin, IRAK shares highest similarity with Drosophila Pelle. IRAK and Pelle are 32% identical throughout the kinase domain and 50% identical in a region spanning kinase subdomains IV to VII (Fig. 2B). This is significantly higher than the 25% identity shared between IRAK and the second most related animal protein, human mixed-lineage kinase (21). Sequence analysis did not reveal any obvious functional motif in regions outside the kinase domain. Weak sequence similarity was noticed in the NH2terminal regions of IRAK and Pelle (Fig. 2C). The NH2-terminus of Pelle is required  i:0X_V-43  -T "Xi  FV&amp;lt;.,  sTvrft  EN WN PM  for its interaction with Tube (22). Northern blot analysis of RNA prepared from various tissues revealed a 3.5-kb mRNA that hybridized to IRAK cDNA (Fig. 3). The size of the mRNA confirmed the size of the cDNA clone isolated. Consistent with the pleiotropic effects of IL-1 on diverse cell types, small amounts of IRAK mRNA were detected in all tissues examined. To investigate whether the association of IRAK with IL-IRI was IL-1-dependent, we used protein immunoblot analysis to detect IRAK in the receptor complex before and after IL-1 treatment (Fig. 4A). IRAK antiserum (23) recognized a diffuse band ranging from -80 to -100 kD in IL-IRI immunocomplexes prepared from 293 IL-IRI cells treated with IL-1. No such protein was detected in immunocomplexes from untreated cells. IRAK was not detected in the immunoprecipitates of parental 293 cells that expressed small amounts of IL-IRI. After being subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction in the presence of nonradioactive ATP, IRAK present in the receptor complex migrated as a sharp band at -100 kD, identical in size to the  K-.V  Mil NaCI, 2 M urea, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% NP-40)]. Proteins that remained bound were eluted with 50 ml of the elution buffer (buffer 3 with 7 M urea) overnight at 4°C with rocking. The eluted material was loaded onto a 0.5-ml Q Sepharose column. After they were washed extensively with the elution buffer, proteins bound (including ppl 00) were eluted with 1.5 ml of the elution buffer with 0.5 M NaCI. The eluate was concentrated in a Microcon 50 (Amicon) to 50 pLl, diluted with 1 ml of isoelectrofocusing sample buffer (15), concentrated again to 50 pul, and then subjected to 2D gel electrophoresis.

We seeded 293 cells in 1 00-mm plates at a density of 30% and transfected them on the following day with IL-1RI expression plasmid (10 ,ug) (12) and pNeoSRoell (1 ,ug) containing the G418 resistance gene by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (25). Cells that stably incorporated transfected genes were selected with G418 (600 .g/ml) (Gibco). Ten individual colonies were cloned and expanded. IL-RI expression on the cell surface was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis with antibody to IL-i RI. Four clones that showed adequate levels of IL-1 RI expression were adapted to suspension culture in C02-independent minimum essential medium (MEM, Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glucose (4.5 g/ml), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), streptomycin (100 ig/ml), and penicillin (100 pg/mI). 14.

TECHNICAL COMMENTSE  J.  ,W  How Much Solar Radiation Do Clouds Absorb? Anomalous absorption of solar radiation by clouds is said to exist (1, 2) because shortwave absorption inferred from solar flux measurements often exceeds theoretical prediction. R. D. Cess et al. (3) suggest that solar absorption in clouds is not only significantly larger than the model prediction, but also much larger than inferred by previous measurements, including those that originally suggested the anomaly. Current understanding predicts that absorption of solar radiation by the entire atmospheric column containing clouds is only slightly enhanced over absorption by an equivalent clear sky column. Theory predicts that cloud absorption can exceed 20% of incoming radiation (4) and that this absorption occurs in place of rather than in addition to clear sky absorption. Significant absorption by cloud thus does not imply anomalous absorption, and the data collected in an aircraft in the study by Pilewskie and Valero (5, 6), when averaged, is actually consistent with current understanding. Thus, neither report (3, 5) indicates that cloud absorption (as opposed to the total column absorption) is actually enhanced. Measurement of atmospheric absorption is difficult to make, as it requires measurement of all radiation flowing into and from a volume. In measurements made from airSCIENCE *  bisulfite, leupeptin (10 jig/ml), aprotinin (10 pg/ml), 0.1 % NP-40, and 10% (v/v) glycerol]. After incubation on ice for 30 min with occasional rocking, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 2000g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1 25,000g for 2 hours. Supernatants were stored at -700C. 15. First-dimensional electrophoresis was isoelectrofocusing. The tube gel preparation and running conditions were described previously [O'Farrell, J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4007 (1975)]. A pH gradient was created with ampholines pH 5.0 to 7.0 and pH 3.5 to 9.5 (Pharmacia) blended at a ratio of 1:1. Second-dimensional separation was achieved with 7% SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). 16. After thawing, the extracts were centrifuged at 1 25,000g for 2 hours. Supernatants were incubated with 35 mg of rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) raised to IL-1 RI (12) and protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads (25 ml) (Pharmacia) for 4 hours at 4°C with rocking. The beads were collected in a glass Econo-column (Bio-Rad), washed with 250 ml of wash buffer 1 [50 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 250 mM NaCI, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 % NP-40, 20 mM ,B-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.4 mM PMSF, and 1 mM sodium metabisulfite], and resuspended in 50 ml of kinase buffer [20 mM tris-HCI (pH 7.6), 1 mM DTT, 20 mM MgCI2, 20 mM ,B-glycerophosphate, 20 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.4 mM PMSF, 1 mM sodium metabisulfite, 5 puM unlabeled ATP, and 100 piCi of [y-32P]ATP)]. The phosphorylation reaction was incubated at 30°C for 15 min and was then incubated with unlabeled ATP (100 ,uM) for 15 min. The protein A beads were collected and washed sequentially with 150 ml of wash buffer 1, 150 ml of wash buffer 2 [50 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 1 M NaCI, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 % NP-401 and 150 ml of wash buffer 3 [50 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mM  craft (3, 5), the volume is ill-defined, and measurement of fluxes on its boundaries is by necessity limited to just a few locations. The usual approach is to measure the fluxes at the cloud top and base along the flight line of the aircraft and to make assumptions about the representativeness of these measurements to the unsampled regions. Given these assumptions, absorption then results as a (usually small) residual of the differences in these fluxes. When error analyses of this approach is considered, the combination of undersampling of boundary fluxes and the natural variability of the real atmosphere is too great to produce credible results (2, 7). This variability results in spuriously large positive and negative excursions-to-absorption calculated as a flux difference (8). Where the study by Cess et al. (3) differs from others is that the abovecloud flux data derive from satellite observations, whereas the surface measurements are obtained from either a single radiometer or a network of 11 radiometers. This analysis is supposed to account for large space and time scale variability and is supposed to accommodate undersampled boundary fluxes. The report (3) does not contain an error analysis and or evidence to support this assumption.

																																									<Abstract>The tyrosine kinases Flt4, Flt1, and Flk1 (or KDR) constitute a family of endothelial cell-specific receptors with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and a split kinase domain. Flt1 and Flk1 have been shown to play key roles in vascular development; these two receptors bind and are activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). No ligand has been identified for Flt4, whose expression becomes restricted during development to the lymphatic endothelium. We have identified cDNA clones from a human glioma cell line that encode a secreted protein with 32% amino acid identity to VEGF. This protein, designated VEGF-related protein (VRP), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Flt4, stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Flt4 expressed in mammalian cells, and promotes the mitogenesis of human lung endothelial cells. VRP fails to bind appreciably to the extracellular domain of Flt1 or Flk1. The protein contains a C-terminal, cysteine-rich region of about 180 amino acids that is not found in VEGF. A 2.4-kb VRP mRNA is found in several human tissues including adult heart, placenta, ovary, and small intestine and in fetal lung and kidney.</Abstract>

																																									<Abstract>The kinetics of amyloid fibril formation by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are typical of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. This type of mechanism suggests that the study of the interaction of Abeta with itself can provide some valuable insights into Alzheimer disease amyloidosis. Interaction of Abeta with itself was explored with the yeast two-hybrid system. Fusion proteins were created by linking the Abeta fragment to a LexA DNA-binding domain (bait) and also to a B42 transactivation domain (prey). Protein-protein interactions were measured by expression of these fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring lacZ (beta-galactosidase) and LEU2 (leucine utilization) genes under the control of LexA-dependent operators. This approach suggests that the Abeta molecule is capable of interacting with itself in vivo in the yeast cell nucleus. LexA protein fused to the Drosophila protein bicoid (LexA-bicoid) failed to interact with the B42 fragment fused to Abeta, indicating that the observed Abeta-Abeta interaction was specific. Specificity was further shown by the finding that no significant interaction was observed in yeast expressing LexA-Abeta bait when the B42 transactivation domain was fused to an Abeta fragment with Phe-Phe at residues 19 and 20 replaced by Thr-Thr (AbetaTT), a finding that is consistent with in vitro observations made by others. Moreover, when a peptide fragment bearing this substitution was mixed with native Abeta-(1-40), it inhibited formation of fibrils in vitro as examined by electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the two-hybrid system can be used to study the interaction of Abeta monomers and to define the peptide sequences that may be important in nucleation-dependent aggregation.</Abstract>

																																									<Abstract>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in various cell types is induced by hypoxia and other stimuli. VEGF mediates endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis, vascular growth, and vascular permeability via the endothelial cell receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) and FLT-1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to identify a positively charged surface in VEGF that mediates binding to KDR/Flk-1. Arg82, Lys84 and His86, located in a hairpin loop, were found to be critical for binding KDR/Flk-1, while negatively charged residues, Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, were associated with FLT-1 binding. A VEGF model based on PDGFb indicated these positively and negatively charged regions are distal in the monomer but are spatially close in the dimer. Mutations within the KDR site had minimal effect on FLT-1 binding, and mutants deficient in FLT-1 binding did not affect KDR binding. Endothelial cell mitogenesis was abolished in mutants lacking KDR affinity; however, FLT-1 deficient mutants induced normal proliferation. These results suggest dual sets of determinants in the VEGF dimer that cross-link cell surface receptors, triggering endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this mutational analysis implicates KDR, but not FLT-1, in VEGF induction of endothelial cell proliferation.</Abstract>

Sign In as Member / Individual Isolation and characterization of a vascular endothelial cell mitogen produced by pituitary-derived folliculo stellate cells D Gospodarowicz , J A Abraham , and J Schilling Cancer Research Institute, University of California Medical Center, San Francisco 94143. Abstract A growth factor with specificity for vascular endothelial cells has been identified in conditioned medium of pituitary-derived folliculo stellate cells. This factor, named folliculo stellate-derived growth factor (FSdGF), was purified to homogeneity by a combination of heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography, Bio-Gel P-60 exclusion chromatography, Mono S ion-exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic chromatography on a C4 reverse-phase HPLC column. FSdGF was characterized as a homodimer composed of two subunits with a molecular mass of 23 kDa. FSdGF was a potent mitogen for vascular endothelial cells with activity detectable at 25 pg/ml and saturation at 500 pg/ml. It did not stimulate the proliferation of other cell types such as bovine vascular smooth muscle cells, corneal endothelial cells, adrenal cortex cells, granulosa cells, BALB/MK cells, or BHK-21 cells. Microsequencing revealed an N-terminal sequence having no significant homology to any known protein. The release of FSdGF by pituitary cells and its target cell specificity raise the possibility that FSdGF may play a role in angiogenesis. CiteULike Complore Connotea Del.icio.us Digg What's this?

																																										<Abstract>Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.</Abstract>

Gerfen et al., Science 250, 1429 (1990). Cocaine hydrochloride was obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA, Research Triangle Park, NC) and dissolved in saline. Details for intravenous catheter implantation and the self-administration apparatus were described previously [D. W. Self, A. W. McClenahan, D. BeitnerJohnson, R. Z. Terwilliger, E. J. Nestler, Synapse 21, 312 (1995)]. Briefly, rats self-administered cocaine during their light cycle under a fixed ratio 1 :time out 5 s schedule (0.5 mg of cocaine per kilogram of body weight delivered in a 0.1 ml volume over 10 s) in daily 4-hour reinstatement test sessions. All stimuli associated with the infusion (for example, the cue light and pump noise) were the same during both the cocaine and saline phases. After three consecutive tests with low responding in the saline phase (less than five responses in the final hour), the animals were given an intraperitoneal priming injection of a dopamine agonist, or of the drug vehicle, 30 min into the saline phase. The number of nonreinforced responses was measured during the final hour of the saline phase. The response totals from the final hour were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test of related subjects. Priming test sessions were always preceded by baseline test sessions with less than five lever presses in the final hour, and the order of presentation of agonist and dose was counterbalanced across animals. All dopamine agonists were obtained from Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA), dissolved in saline, and injected in a volume of 2 ml per kilogram of body weight. D. L. Levesque et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 8155 (1992). Although 7-OH-DPAT was purported originally to bind selectively at D0 receptors under certain experimental conditions in vitro, recent evidence suggests that 7-OH-DPAT can bind with high affinity to both D2 and D0 (D2-like) receptors and can produce effects at both receptors in vivo [C. H. Large and C. M. Stubbs, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 15, 46 (1994); J. E. Freedman, B. L. Waszczak, R. F. Cox, G. J. Greif, ibid., p. 173; A. M. Gonzalez and D. R. Sibley, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 272, R1 (1995)]. K. Tsuruta et al., Nature 292, 463 (1981). P. H. Andersen and J. A. Jansen, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 188, 335 (1990). C. B. Hubner and G. F.

Horizontal locomotor activity was measured with 12 drug-naive rats in a circular apparatus described previously [M. J. D. Miserendino, X. Guitart, R. Z. Terwilliger, S. Chi, E. J. Nestler, Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 4, 440 (1993)]. The rats were habituated to the apparatus for 90 min/day for four consecutive days. On days 5, 7, 9, and 11, the rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of SKF 82958, 7-OH-DPAT, caffeine (Sigma), or the drug vehicle (saline) in a counterbalanced order, and horizontal locomotor activity was measured for the next 90 min. Totals were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test of related subjects. Drug-injection days were separated by base 18. 19.  20.  22. 23.  21.  24.  25.  26.  saline-treated rats. During the second hour, most rats treated with SKF 82958 initiated cocaine self-administration, presumably as the drug wore off.

Klauck,* Maree C. Faux,* Kirstin Labudda, Lorene K. Langeberg, Susan Jaken, John D. Scottt Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.  Control of multiple cellular events by protein phosphorylation requires many levels of regulation in order to generate specific cellular responses. One regulatory mechanism is that kinases and phosphatases are maintained at discrete cellular locations through their interaction with targeting proteins (1). Enzymes may be positioned in close proximity to specific substrates, which then can be efficiently modified in response to the appropriate signals. Evidence supporting this model has shown that protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases couple to downstream cytoplasmic enzymes through adapter proteins that contain SH2 and SH3 domains (2). Serine-threonine kinases and phosphatases are also maintained by scaffold proteins or anchoring proteins. In yeast, the scaffold T. M. Klauck, M. C. Faux, K. Labudda, L. K. Langeberg, J. D.

In neurons, PKA and CaN are both localized to postsynaptic densities (PSDs) by association with AKAP79, which positions both enzymes close to key neuronal substrates (4). Because other neuronal signaling enzymes are present at the PSD (5), we investigated their potential to associate with the anchoring protein AKAP79. PKC, a family of serine-threonine kinases, is tethered to the PSD through association with binding proteins (6). We used a solid-phase binding assay (overlays) with PKC as a probe (7) on bovine brain extracts (8) to detect several PKC-binding proteins, including a protein that migrated with the same  *These authors contributed equally to this manuscript. tTo whom correspondence should be addressed.  mobility as a prominent RII-binding protein of 75 kD (9). This band corresponds to AKAP75, the bovine homolog of AKAP79 (10), indicating that the anchoring protein could bind both RII and PKC. Indeed, recombinant AKAP79 bound to 1589  SCIENCE  *  VOL. 271  *  15 MARCH 1996  Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on November 6, 2009  11  PKC in the presence of Ca2 + and phosphatidylserine (Fig. IA). The a, 13I, and 13I1 isoforms of PKC interacted with AKAP79, whereas other signaling enzymes that are associated with the PSD, such as Ca calmoddulin-dependent protein kinase II and the type I phosphatase, did not hind the AKAP (1 ). Phosphorylation of AKAP79 by PKC had no quLalitative effect on binding (Fig. 1, A and B). This result suggests that the AKAP binds in a different manner from other PKC-substrate- binding proteins such as MARCKS (myristoylated alaninerich C kinase substrate) and -y-adducin, for which phosphorylation regulates association with PKC (12). We mapped the PKCbinding region by screening a family of AKAP79 fragments (Fig. IC) (13). Fragmients encompassing the first 75 residues of AKAP79 bound PKC, whereas COOH-terminal fragments containing the RIl- and CaN-binding regions did not (Fig. ID). These data imply that PKC binds to AKAP79 at a site that is distinct from those bound by RII and CaN (4, 14). Because basic and hydrophobic regions are determinants for binding of certain proteins to PKC (15), we focused on a region located between residues 31 to 52 of AKAP79 (Fig. 2A). A peptide encompassing this region specifically blocked the interaction of AKAP79 with PKC in the overlay assay (Fig. 2B) but did not affect RII binding to the AKAP (Fig. 2C) (16). Conversely, the RII anchoring inhibitor peptide IAKAP79(390-411)] did not affect PKC binding (Fig. 2B) but did block interaction with RII (Fig. 2C). This result indicates that residues 3.1 to 52 represent the principal determinants for PKC binding. Many kinases or phosphatases bound to anchoring proteins are maintained in an inactive state (1, 4). Accordingly, recoombinant AKAP79 protein inhibited PKC activity (17) with a half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of 0.35 + 0.06 pM (n = 3) (Fig. 2D). In addition, the AKAP79 peptide (residues 31 to 52) and a recombinant AKAP79 fragment (residues 1 to 75) inhibited PKC activity with IC50 values of 2.0 + 0.6 FwM (n = 4) and 1.6 + 0.3 v1M (n = 4), respectively (Fig. 2D). In contrast, AKAP79(31-52) did not inhibit the activity of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Fig. 2D) (18). Inhibition of PKC activity by AKAP79(31-52) was mixed, with an apparent inhibition constant (K,) of 1.41 ± 0.28 FiM (n = 3) (Fig. 2E). The secondary plot of the Michaelis constant divided by the maximal velocity ( as a function of inhibitor concentration was nonlinear, suggesting binding at more than one site (Fig. 2E, inset). Preincubation of AKAP79(3152) with excess calmodulin prevented inhibition of PKC activity (19). We propose that PKC is localized and inhibited by AKAP79 in a Ca2 ± - and phosphatidylserine-depen1590  dent manner, and additional signals, such as Ca2+-calmodulin, may be required to release the enzyme. The interaction of PKC and AKAP79 was independently confirmed by coprecipitation of the complex from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells in the presence of exogenous recombinant AKAP79 Fig. 1.

Further evidence for the association of PKC and AKAP79 was provided by double-immunofluorescence staining (22) of HEK 293 cells overexpressing AKAP79 (23). PKC and AKAP79 exhibited limited staining at the cell periphery in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3B), but the staining pattern was markedly enhanced in transfected cells, demonstrating that overexpression of AKAP79 increases PKC targeting to the periphery of the cell (Fig. 3B). Collectively, our data indicate that PKC binds AKAP79, and it is likely that this complex occurs in vivo. AKAP79 may act as a signaling scaffold for the subcellular targeting of PKA, CaN, and PKC. To demonstrate that these enzymes bind to AKAP79 in mammalian cells, we isolated ternary complexes from bovine brain. We used affinity purification of the R subunit of PKA on adenosine 3' ,5 '-monophosphate (cAMP)-agarose to  copurify AKAP75 (Fig. 4A) (24). If PKC were bound to the complex via the AKAP, then we would expect PKC to be present after elution of bound proteins with cAMP. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that PKC was indeed present (Fig. 4B), showing that RII and PKC can bind simultaneously to AKAP75. In separate experiments, a ternary complex of CaN, PKC, and AKAP75 was isolated from bovine brain extracts by immunoprecipitation with antibodies against CaN A subunit (25). Immunoblotting demonstrated that the precipitated complex contained PKC (Fig. 4C), whereas control experiments with nonimmune serum were negative. This result indicated that CaN and PKC can bind to the AKAP simultaneously; therefore, different combinations of PKA, CaN, and PKC can bind the AKAP in bovine brain. Isolation of a quaternary complex was not feasible because of the low stoichiometry of binding  for each enzyme to the AKAP (4, 26) and the probable transient nature of the protein-protein interactions. AKAP79 appears to be a mammalian scaffold protein that coordinates the location and activity of three prominent signaling enzymes. Although AKAP79 functionally resembles the yeast scaffold protein STE5, there are differences between the two signaling scaffolds. The AKAP79 complex is likely to respond to three distinct activation signals, whereas a single upstream event, the activation of STE20, is sufficient to transduce signals from one kinase to the next in the STE5 scaffold (3). In addition, the AKAP signaling complex is targeted to sites near the postsynaptic membrane in neurons. Immunoflourescence studies demonstrate that PKC and the AKAP are concentrated at sites below the plasma membrane at the cell body and in dendritic bundles of hippocampal neurons (Fig. 4D). The dendritic staining pattern is consistent with the colocalization of both proteins at the PSD. Targeting to the PSD would ensure that each enzyme in the signaling complex is well placed to receive signals transduced across the synapse and that each enzyme is colocalized with specific substrate proteins. Potential substrates include ao-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA)-kainate and Ca2+ channels, which are modulated by anchored PKA, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are activated by PKC and attenuated by CaN (27). PKC may also modulate the targeting of certain NMDA receptor subtypes to the postsynaptic membranes (28). Thus synaptic signaling events appear to be coordinated, and we propose that this occurs through a modular scaffold protein, AKAP79, that anchors two second messenger-regulated kinases and one phosphatase.  amam grinding frozen tissue with a mortar and pestle in liquid N2 and homogenizing in a hypotonic buffer [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mM MgCI2, 10 mM KCI, 0.5% Triton X-100, leupeptin (2 ,ug/ml), pepstatin (2 Lg/ml), and 1 mM each of dithiothreitol (DTT), benzamidine, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride] in a 15-ml Dounce homogenizer.

These hairpins are intermediates leading to the formation of assembled antigen receptor genes. It is shown here that the hairpins are formed by a chemical mechanism of direct trans-esterification, very similar to the early steps of transpositional recombination and retroviral integration. A minor variation in the reaction is sufficient to divert the process from transposition to hairpin formation.  18. 19. 20.  Functional immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes are assembled during vertebrate lymphoid development from separate gene segments. This DNA rearrangement, called V(D)J recombination, takes place at recombination signal sequences (RSSs) that specify the border of the coding segments (1). Double strand breaks (DSBs) at the RSS border depend on expression of the RAGJ and RAG2 genes (2) and are probably intermediates in this recombination reaction (3, 4). After DSB formation, a pair of signal ends or coding ends is coupled to tively. eral that also involved general DSB repair (4). We recently developed a cell-free assay in which specific cleavage at RSSs requires only the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins (5, 6).

The products of the cleavage reaction are a blunt, 5'-phosphorylated signal end and a coding end with a hairpin structure. These are the same species detected in recombinationally active cells. Formation of the new phosphodiester bond at the tip of the hairpin requires energy. Because no adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or other high-energy cofactor is present in the cleavage reaction, the energy is likely to be derived from one of the broken phosphodiester bonds. The energy of the bond broken in the initial nicking reaction does not appear to be conserved: DNA substrates with a preexisting nick at this position are efficiently converted into hairpins (6). Thus, the energy of the phosphodiester bond in the bottom strand opposite the nick must be conserved, either through a covalent protein-DNA intermediate or by direct trans-esterification.

Using the two-hybrid system, we have isolated from a human heart cDNA library the entire coding sequence of human ~I syntrophin, therefore confirming for the first time this interaction via an in vivo approach. In addition, we have reduced the interaction domain to the distal half of ~1 syntrophin. Key words: Protein-protein interaction; 59 D A P ; Duchenne  h u m a n heart c D N A library using the two-hybrid system in order to look for new partners of dystrophin or of its more distal isoform, apodystrophin 1. Using a bait covering exon 64 to 75 (but deleted of exon 71), we have identified among positive clones several ones coding for a h u m a n ct syntrophin, very homologous to mouse and rabbit etl syntrophins.  2. Material and methods 2.1. Two-hybrid constructs  muscular dystrophy  1. Introduction Dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene, is thought to link the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscle through a glycoprotein complex (DGC). This D G C is composed of at least five sarcolemmal glycoproteins (~ and 13 dystroglycans, ct, 13, and y sarcoglycans) and intracellular proteins belonging to the same family: syntrophins [1-4]. Syntrophins are a heterogeneous group of phosphorylated 58-59 kDa proteins encoded by at least three different genes which are classified in acidic (ct) and basic ([~) components and show a different expression pattern [5]. Alpha-1 syntrophin, which has been cloned in mouse [6] and rabbit [7], is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle. Beta-1 syntrophin, which has been isolated in human, is ubiquitously expressed but at lower levels in brain and heart than in other tissues [8]. Finally, 132 syntrophin, cloned in mouse and only partially in h u m a n [5,8], is expressed at low levels in numerous tissues but seems to be especially concentrated at the neuromuscular junction in muscle [9]. A m o n g D G C proteins, only syntrophins and 1~ dystroglycan have been involved in direct interactions [10,11] with the carboxy-terminus of dystrophin or with an isoform of dystrophin encoding only the last two domains from exon 63 to 79, namely apodystrophin 1 [10]. Binding sites have been localized within residues 3445 3494 of h u m a n dystrophin for mouse txl syntrophin and within residues 3495-3544 for 131 syntrophin by overlay assays with fusion proteins [12] or by co-immunoprecipitation with in vitro translated proteins [13]. However, no in vivo assay has ever demonstrated this interaction. As dystrophin shows a distinct subcellular localization in heart and skeletal muscle, it has been suggested that it could play different roles in these two tissues, potentially by different protein-protein interactions. We have therefore screened a *Corresponding author. Fax: (33) (1) 44 41 24 21. SSDI S00 1 4-5 7 9 3 ( 9 6 ) 0 0 2 1 4- 1  Human dystrophin carboxy-terminus encoding residues 3103-3549 was generated by polymerase chain reaction on the full length dystrophin cDNA deleted of exon 71 and kindly provided by M. Koenig (lllkirch, France), using the following forward and reverse oligonucleotides with incorporated restriction sites: 64 ID EcoRI: 5' CGG AAT TCT CAG CTT ATA GG 3' and 75 CT XhoI: 5' CCG CTC GAG AGG TGG GCA TCA 3'. The amplified product was cloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pGBT9 plasmid (Clontech) containing Gal4 binding domain downstream from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADH1 constitutive promoter and the resulting construct was called pGBT9-3. The insertion was entirely sequenced using dideoxyNTPs and sequenase 2.0 according to the manufacturer's specification (U.S. Biochemical). The background of this construct was appreciated by co-transformation with control plasmids containing the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain (Gal4AD) alone as pGAD424 (Clontech), or with an in phase cDNA such as those for Snif4 [14] or Raf [15] in HF7c yeast strain: Mat a, ura 3-52, his 3-200, ade2-101, 1ys2-801, trpl-901, leu2-3, 112, ga14-542, ga180-538, ura3 : ." Gal4 binding sites-CYC1-LacZ, lys2::Gall-His3. No background for I~-galactosidase activity was obtained after overnight incubation at 30°C or for histidine expression after 5 days at 30°C on selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine and histidine and supplemented with 15 mM 3amino-l,2,4-triazole (3AT) for all double-transformants. 2.2. Library screening  HF7c yeast strain already transformed with pGBT9-3 plasmid, which contains a tryptophan (TRP1) marker, was transformed with 250 ktg DNA of a commercial human heart cDNA library cloned into plasmid pGAD10 (Clontech), which contains the Gal4 activation domain and a leucine (LEU) auxotrophic marker using the already described lithium acetate method [16]. 350 000 transformants were plated on selection plates lacking tryptophan, leucine and histidine and supplemented with 15 mM 3AT. After 12 days, colonies grown on this selective medium were replicated on Whatman paper (no. 40). After overnight incubation at 30°C, these filters were immersed in liquid nitrogen for a few seconds and layered on Whatman paper (no. 3) humidified with 3 ml of Z buffer and incubated at 30°C. Z buffer contains 60 mM Na2HPO4, 40 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM KC1, 1 mM MgSO4, 30 mM 13-mercaptoethanol and 5-bromo-4 chloroindolyl-13-D-galactoside (XGal) at a final c'oncentration of 0.2 mg/ml. 2.3. Rescue o f positive plasmids  To rescue GaI4AD fusion plasmids, total yeast DNA was isolated according to the method of Hoffman and Winston [17]. To avoid waste of time in this step, 96 different DNA preparations were placed in 96 well microplates and analyzed by pooling DNAs from each of the 8 rows and 12 columns. Each of these 20 pools was then used to directly electroporate E. coli HB101 as recommended in the Bio-Rad user's guide. This step allows one to eliminate the Gal4 DNA-binding  S0014-5793/96/$12.00 © 1996 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. All rights reserved.  A.

Subcloning of syntrophin plasmids The EcoRI/BgllI 0.45 kb fragment of clone 5B was subcloned in pGAD424 plasmid, which has been digested with EcoRI and BamHI, st, that the syntrophin fragment was in phase with Gal4AD, giving the 5B1 construct. After a BgllI digestion of clone 5B, fragments of 0.4 aT~d0.85 kb were subcloned in pGAD424 digested with BamHI, giving clone 5B2 and 5B3, respectively. These 3 plasmids were co-transfirmed in Hf7c with the same specific (pGBT9-3) and non-specific plasmids (Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to non-specific cDNAs) aad colonies were allowed to grow on selectivemedium and tested for 1_~cZ activity. 3 Results To search for cDNA clones encoding proteins that interact u ith the carboxy-terminal part of dystrophin, we used the t,vo-hybrid system for detection of protein-protein interaction i~ yeast [18]. The HF7c yeast strain used for the screen harbors integrated LacZ and HIS3 gene under the control of (;a14 multimerized sites and Gall promoter, respectively. q hese marker genes become transcriptionally active only if a fanctional trans-activator binds on these promoter sites. As bait, we created a chimeric plasmid, pGBT9-3, which contains amino acids 3103-3549 but deleted of amino acids 3409-3421 of the dystrophin sequence, fused in frame to the (;a14 DNA-binding domain (Gal4DBD).  We first verified that pGBT9-3 lacked transcriptional activity on its own by co-transforming the HF7c yeast strain with this vector and control vectors containing the GaI4AD alone (pGAD424, Clontech) or fused in phase with different cDNAs as Raf or Snif4 cDNAs. To identify cDNA clones encoding proteins that interacted with dystrophin, we transformed the above yeast strain with pGBT9-3 and a human heart cDNA library in which the oligo(dT) and random primed cDNAs (mean size 1.7 kb) were fused to the Gal4AD. Screening 350 000 independent transformants for activation of the LacZ and histidine markers yielded 640 colonies that stained for [5-galactosidase activity between 2 h and an overnight 30°C incubation. Two frequent problems encountered in two-hybrid assays are to isolate positive clones in the original cDNA screen that turn out not to be confirmed after purification of the isolated plasmid, or not to be specific. To determine whether activation of the marker genes reflected a specific interaction, and in order to accelerate this time-consuming step when numerous clones have been isolated in the first screening, each eDNA clone was rescued from yeast and 96 DNAs were pooled in series of 12 and 8 DNAs (see section 2). Each pool of DNAs was used to electroporate E. coli HB101, allowing us to perform only 20 electroporations instead of 96. A minipreparation of plasmid DNA was performed after a 2 day liquid culture in M9 medium at 37°C (Wizard kit, Promega) and the DNA obtained was retransformed into the same HF7c yeast strain, either with the original bait pGBT9-3, or with different control plasmid in which the Gal4 DBD is alone  126  A. Castell6 et al./FEBS Letters 383 (1996) 124-128  (pGBT9-) or fused to a non-specific cDNA such as those for p53 [19] of Snif 1 [14] which are not expected to interact with dystrophin. These transformed yeasts were directly spotted onto selective medium depleted of tryptophan and leucine. Grown spots were tested for LacZ and histidine activity. On the first 192 tested plasmids collected in 40 pools, 4 pools (4, 5, B, D) corresponding to 2 columns and 2 rows stained intensely for 13-galactosidase activity within 1 h and grew on selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine and histidine and supplemented with 15 mM 3AT in 48 h, only with the original bait and not with negative control plasmids. Three other pools showed LacZ activity after more than 4 h. We therefore decided to focus on the 4 earlier positive pools. Crossing yeast D N A plasmids between positive rows and col umns  (clones 5B, 4D) were retransformed into HF7c with the different negative controls. Both showed the same histidine and LacZ expression pattern as the corresponding pools (Fig. 1). To determine whether clones 5B and 4D might represent previously identified proteins, we sequenced the 5'-and 3'-ends of the c D N A and searched with fasta and blast algorithms in the database for amino acid and nucleotide homologies. Both clones showed a strong homology with rabbit and mouse ctl syntrophins (Fig. 2). 5B and 4D clones were entirely sequenced and showed differences only in their 5'-non-coding extremity (after 14 common 5'-nucleotides, clone 4D shows a 72 nucleotide long D N A stretch, homologous to rabbit syntrophin, which is not present in clone 5B; afterwards both  A 4D ~ ~ -46 ATG GCG TCC GGC AGG CCG GCC CL-X~CGC ACC 30 M A S G R P A P R T CGC GCC G G G G C ~ GGC qL~G G G G G C C GGC G C G C ~ G C G A TGG CAG C G G G T G CCT 96 R A G A G S G A G A E R W Q R V P GAC GTG CTG ACC GTG AGC ~ GCC GAC GGC GAC CCT GOlf CCC GAG CCC GGC 162 D V L T V S P A D G D P G P E P G GAG CCC GCG CAG CTC AAC GAC GCC GCG GAG CCG GGC GC~ GGG CCC CCG CAG 228 E P A Q L N D A A E P G A G P P Q CTG CTC CAG CGG CGC CGC GTG ACG GTG CGC AAG GCC GAC GCC GGT'GGG CI~ 294 L L Q R R R V T V R K A D A G G L GGC GGC CGG GAG AAC A A G A T G CC~ ATT CTC ATT TCC A A G A T C ~ AAG G G A 360 G G R E N K M P I L I S K I F K G A C A GAG GCC CTT TIT GTG GGG GAT GCC ATC CTG qL~f GTG A A T GGG G A A GAC 426 T E A L F V G D A I L S V N G E D CAT GAT GAG GCG GTG CAG GTC CTC AAG AAG A C A GGC A~/~ GAG GTG GTG CTG 492 H D E A V Q V L K K T G K E V V L AAG GAC GTC TCA ~ TAT TIC AAG AAC ~ ACT GGT GGG ACC TCG GTC GGC 558 K D V S P Y F K N S T G G T S V G GCC TCA ~ CTT CAG CGG CAG CC~ TCC qL~C CCT GGC CC~ A C A CC~ CGG AAC 624 A S P L Q R Q P S S P G P T P R N CAC ATG TCC TTG AAG ATG G C A TAT GTC TCG A~3 AGG TGC ACC CCC AAT GAC 690 H M S L K M A Y V S K R C T P N D CTG GAG A T C TGC TCG GCA GAT GGT CAA GAC ACC CTC TTC CTG A G G GCC A A G 756 L E I C S A D G Q D T L F L R A K ~ qL~G '1-O3GCG ACT GCC ATC CAA GCC CAG GTC AAT ACT CTG ACG ~ CGG 822 R S W A T A I Q A Q V N T L T P R CAG GCA CTG TTG G C A ~ ACC ~ C A C A GCT GGG AGC CAG GAC ATC A A G CAG 888 Q A L L A A T S T A G S Q D I K Q GAG CAG CTG CCC AGT GGG GGC A C A GCC CCC ACC CYG C4L~ CTG CTA ACT GAA 954 E Q L P S G G T A P T L A L L T E TAC TIG TCT CTC CC~ GAG ACC CGC GAG GCC CTG AGC CGG CCA GCC CGT ACT 1020 Y L S L P E T R E A L S R P A R T ACC A G A ~ GTG CAC TCA GGC CC~ TCC AAG GGC TCA GTG CC~ TAC GAT GCA 1086 T R L V H S G P S K G S V P Y D A CTG CGC ACG GGC ACG CGT CAC GGT GTG GAC ACT CAC CTG TTC ~f~C GTG GAG 1152 L R T G T R H G V D T H L F S V E GCT GCC TGG ACC CGC C~3 CTT G~fG GAT GGC q~T CAC CGG GCC GCC GAG GGT 1218 A A W T R Q L V D G C H R A A E G A C A GCC TGC ACG TGG AAT GGG CGT CCX~ TGC AGC CTG TCT GTG CAC ATC GAC 1284 T A C T W N G R P C S L S V H I D T G G G C G GCT G A G C C A ~ - ' T G C A G C C C G A G C T GTG CTC CTG ~ C A G CCC TTC 1350 W A A E P G A A R A V L L R Q P F qL~f TCA GAT GAC GGT GC~ AGT CTC CIT TTC CTG GAT TIT GGA GGT GCT G A A 1416 S S D D G A S L L F L D F G G A E GAC CTG CAC TCG TGT CCC A A A ACC ATA GTC TTC ATC ATC CAC TCC TTC CTG 1482 D L H S C P K T I V F I I H S F L CGC CTC GGG CTG TTG C ~ TAG ~ T G C A C T 1557 R L G L L A _ ~ 1642 AAGCGGC-ACA GGG G GTG V GCT A CTG L GGC G CTG L TTG L GAG E TGG W TTC F CCG P GAT D GTC V ATT I AAG K GCC A GAG E TCA S GTG V AAG K GAG E GGC G CTG L AGT S CCG P CCA P ATC I GCA A TCC S GTC V GAC D AGC S GAG E GAG E AAG K G~C G GAA E CCA P CTC L CC~ P C~3 Q GGC G AAG K GAG E GCC S A TGACA CTG GAG CTG L E L CTG GCG GAG L A E CGG GAG CAG R E Q GAG GCG CTA E A L A G C ATC A A A S I K GCT GAC CAG A D Q TCT GCT ACC S A T AAG TAT A T G K Y M TCA CCT CCT S P P GAG GCC A A A E A K CCC A G G TAT P R Y GCT ~ T GCG A S A GAT GA~3 CTG D E L TGG CTA ACT W L T CTG CTC CI~ L L L CTC ATC GCC L I A qL-'fTIT GCC S F A CAG GAG CTG Q E L GAG G'I~3TCT E V S TTC A C A CTG F T L CTG CAG A T G L Q M ATC CAG CTG I Q L A A A GTC ACC K V T  Fig. 2.

Human syntrophin sequence shows 95.84% similarity and 92.87% identity with rabbit ctl syntrophin at the amino acid level and 89.28% identity at the nucleotide level.  To investigate further the interaction between human dystrophin and human ~1 syntrophin, we subcloned clone 5B into three parts. Before having the entire sequence of clones 5B and 4D, we first verified that some restriction sites were  128 conserved between rabbit and human. Among BgllI, PstI and PvulI enzymes, used to digest clone 5B, only BgllI gave the expected profile, according to the rabbit sequence. We therefore subcloned the 3 restriction fragments obtained with BgllI in pGAD424 plasmid in the same phase as mouse and rabbit ctl syntrophins. These 3 subclones (5B1, 5B2, 5B3) were tested for their interaction with dystrophin in the two-hybrid system. Only clone 5B3, corresponding to the last 268 amino acids out of the 505 residues of human syntrophin, allows for activation of the reporter histidine and LacZ genes (Fig. 1). 4. Discussion  A. Castell6 et al./FEBS Letters 383 (1996) 124-128 (NOS), a protein recently shown to be complexed with dystrophin and abnormally localized in mdx mouse and Duchenne patients' sarcolemma [21]. The PDZ domain of human txl syntrophin is entirely contained in the 5B1 and 5B2 constructs, with the G L G I sequence present in the 5B1 construct; this domain, therefore, is not involved in the interaction with dystrophin. Instead, the syntrophin/dystrophin binding could involve the conserved 56 carboxy-terminal residues specific to the syntrophin family; we are currently testing this hypothesis. In conclusion, we have confirmed via an in vivo approach the direct interaction between dystrophin and ctl syntrophin and report the coding sequence of the human syntrophin gene, very well conserved with respect to the mouse and rabbit sequences. By pooling yeast DNA, we also propose a timewinning step to demonstrate the specificity of numerous positive clones after a two-hybrid screen in yeast. The domain involved in the dystrophin/ctl syntrophin interaction is located at the distal half of syntrophin, a region particularly conserved among species and members of this family.

References  The syntrophin family is a heterogeneous group of at least three isoforms encoded on three distinct genes. They are all expressed in a wide variety of tissues, but ctl and ~1 syntrophins for example show, in the same tissue, a segregated subcellular distribution. Immunoaffinity isolation of syntrophin from a variety of rat tissues has shown that dystrophin, Dp71 or apodystrophinl and utrophin are able to copurify with syntrophins [10]. Most of the experiments showing direct interaction between dystrophin or its distal isoforms and the different members of the syntrophin family have used immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated proteins, or overlay assays with skeletal muscle extracts [6,12,13]. We have confirmed this interaction between dystrophin and c~l syntrophin in heart by demonstrating an in vivo interaction in yeast using the two-hybrid system. Moreover, using a truncated carboxy-terminal sequence of dystrophin as bait, we have isolated the syntrophin partner among a human heart cDNA library. Previous studies have located the syntrophin binding sites on the dystrophin sequence to amino acids 3445-3494 for ctl syntrophin and amino acids 3495-3535 for [31 syntrophin and have suggested that the flanking region (amino acids 3536 to 3685) also contributes to the stable binding to syntrophin [12]. The dystrophin bait we used ends at residue 3549 and shows strong activation of the reporter gene, suggesting it is, however, sufficient to interact with syntrophin. By immunoprecipitation with in vitro translated fusion proteins, Ahn and Kunkel [13] showed that the interacting region of 131 syntrophin was carried by its carboxy-terminal half (last 335 amino acids of the 537 residues of 131 syntrophin). Accordingly, we demonstrate in this paper that the carboxy-terminal half of ctl syntrophin, 53% homologous with ~1 syntrophin, also interacts with dystrophin. The human coding sequence of ctl syntrophin was not known previously. As expected, it exhibits a strong sequence conservation with rabbit and mouse ct syntrophins. The syntrophin txl gene has been recently located on human chromosome 20 by Froehner's group [20], who also describes four conserved domains in the syntrophin family members: two pleckstrin homology domains, found in many proteins involved in intracellular signalling, a PDZ domain (for post synaptic density protein-95, Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor protein, zonula occludens-1 protein) and a carboxyterminal 56 amino acid domain, highly conserved among species and isoforms and showing no homology with other proteins [20]. The PDZ domain contains a GLG(F/I) sequence, which is present in a heterogeneous family of signalling proteins localized to specialized cell-cell junctions; the GLG(F/I) motif has also been found in nitric oxide synthase protein  [1] Ervasti, J.M., Ohlendieck, K., Kahl, S.D., Gaver, M.G. and Campbell, K.P.

																																												<Abstract>The general transcription factor TFIID nucleates initiation complex formation through direct core promoter binding, commits promoters within chromatin to transcription, and mediates the action of transcriptional activators, a phenomenon that may correlate with enhanced TFIID recruitment or conformational changes in TFIID-promoter complexes. Molecular studies of the multiprotein TFIID complex have identified a primary TATA binding subunit (TBP), TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with and mediate the function of activators and intersubunit interactions but have yielded relatively little insight into the structural organization of the complex or the actual mechanism of transcriptional activation. Here we present biochemical evidence for the structural relevance of histone homologies in the human TFIID subunits hTAF80, hTAF31 and hTAF20/15. Together with analyses of native TFIID complexes and accompanying crystallographic studies, the results suggest that there is a histone octamer-like TAF complex within TFIID.</Abstract>
