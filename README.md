TODO:
- The jar dependencies aren't fully identified, but included. 
  The pom.xml file makes generic refereneces to libs that you
  (likelY) won't find in any repository, but need to install 
  locally from the lib directory. This needs to be scripted
  and ultimatley cleaned up by identifying the version and
  making reference to publicly available jars when/where possible.
